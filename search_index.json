Git Flow\n\n\nFeature branch模型。各个feature之间的代码是隔离的，可以独立地开发、构建、测试。存在两个长期分支：主分支master和开发分支develop。\n前者用于存放对外发布的版本，任何时候在这个分支拿到的，都是稳定的分布版；\n后者用于日常开发，存放最新的开发版。\n1.1.1. 优\n\n适应场景多（没有创建分支解决不了的事情）\n不影响开发进度\n分支使用相对有条理\n确保线上的版本稳定\n\n1.1.2. 劣\n\n分支过多，不宜管理，如何创建，何时删除分支？\n如果特性分支过多的话很容易造成代码冲突，从而提高了合入的成本（feature branch要尽量小，时间跨度不易过长）\n并发开发的分支会相互“堵“\ngit-flow使用git merge --no-ff来合并分支，在多分支的环境下会让History tree变的非常混乱\n同时维护Master和Developer两个分支很多时候是没必要的\nmaster和release对于是重复的\n\n1.2. GitHub Flow\n\nFork方式。只有一个长期分支，就是master，因此用起来非常简单。Github flow 的最大优点就是简单，对于”持续发布”的产品，可以说是最合适的流程。\n\n第一步：根据需求，从master拉出新分支，不区分功能分支或补丁分支。\n第二步：新分支开发完成后，或者需要讨论的时候，就向master发起一个pull request（简称PR）。\n第三步：Pull Request既是一个通知，让别人注意到你的请求，又是一种对话机制，大家一起评审和讨论你的代码。对话过程中，你还可以不断提交代码。\n第四步：你的Pull Request被接受，合并进master，重新部署后，原来你拉出来的那个分支就被删除。（先部署再合并也可。）\n适用场景：\n项目必须是类似于github这种web的项目，或者库、框架、工具并非最终应用的产品，可以进行频繁的产品部署。并且能够迅速的修复发现的问题\n\n1.2.1. 优\n\n只有一个master分支，简单\n\n1.2.2. 劣\n\n使用前提，CI能够在Pull Request阶段覆盖大部分的测试案例。\n对于贡献者的素质要求很高\n\n1.3. GitLab Flow\n\nGitlab flow 的最大原则叫做”上游优先”（upsteam first），即只存在一个主分支master，它是所有其他分支的”上游”。只有上游分支采纳的代码变化，才能应用到其他分支。\ngitlab flow就是git flow和github flow的一个折中方案，既没有git flow那么麻烦，也没有github flow那么简单粗暴。\n对于”持续发布”的项目，它建议在master分支以外，再建立不同的环境分支。比如，”开发环境”的分支是master，”预发环境”的分支是pre-production，”生产环境”的分支是production。\n适用场景：\n\n需要进行预发布的项目\n\n1.3.1. 优\n\n清晰可控\n规则相对git flow来说更简单\n\n1.3.2. 劣\n\n相对于github flow来说，gitlab flow 更复杂\n当维护较多版本时，会变得像git flow似的比较复杂\n\n1.4. Trunk Based Development\n\n主干开发原则：\n\n将任务划分成许多可以在1天以内完成的小模块，以至少每天一次的频率将分支合并到主干\n针对研发的功能编写自动化测试用例，并在本地验证\n降低了破坏trunk的风险，trunk分支不稳定将会阻碍在这个分支上工作的所有人\n执行实时Code Review，代码审核流程不能繁琐\n每次向trunk提交代码时，都应该自动地触发编译和测试\n适用场景：\n对迭代速度要求高，希望需求快速交付上线\n基础架构强，持续集成工具高效\n团队成员习惯 TDD（测试驱动开发），代码自动化测试覆盖率高（至少增量代码的自动化测试覆盖率高）\n\n1.4.1. 优\n\n分支模型简单高效，开发人员易于掌握不容易出现错误操作\n避免了分支合并、冲突解决的困扰\n随时拥有可发布的版本\n有利于持续集成和持续交付\n\n1.4.2. 劣\n\n基础架构要求高：合入到主干的代码若质量不过关将直接阻塞整个团队的开发工作，因此需要高效的持续集成平台进行把关\n自动化测试要求高：需有完备单元测试代码，确保在代码合入主干前能在获得快速和可靠的质量反馈\n最好有代码评审：若代码质量要求高，需要配套代码评审（CR）机制，在代码提交到主干时，触发 CR，通过 Peer Review 后才能正式合入\n最好有特性开关：主干开发频发合入主干的情况下，特性拆分得很小，可能是半成品特性，需要配套特性开关（Feature Toggle），只有当特性整体开发完才通过灰度发布等手段逐步打开\n\n1.5.

Git恢复之前版本的两种方法reset、revert（图文详解）\n来自https://blog.csdn.net/yxlshk/article/details/79944535\n1.12. 2.12    Git证书问题，提示certificate signed authority error\n从git上clone代码之后，push的时候如果出现下面问题，是本地git证书有问题\n解决方法：\nwindows请按照下面链接中的第二种方法修复https://code.huawei.com/codeclub/support/issues/287\n把附件的证书文件ca-bundle.crt 中的内容追加到本地证书文件后面\n1.13. 2.15    Push代码时自动merge：\nPush代码的时候，如果远端分支上有最近的更新是本地分支上没有的，需要将远端分支上最新的代码更新到本地。这是git对合入时序性的要求，必须遵循。\n简单的情况，需要merge，但是没有冲突，即填写自动merge的注释即可，会自动进行merge。\n1.14. 2.16    冲突产生的原因：\nGit合入有时序性，即提交到远程中心仓库的代码必须是按照时间顺序的\n1.14.1. 2.16.1    冲突产生\n1、master与分支冲突\n在master分支，修改a.cpp为：\n提交到服务器上。\n在dev_test分支，修改a.cpp为\n提交到服务器上。\n如果此时两个分支合并，Git就无法\"快速合并\"了，就会生成冲突。当通过命令行merge时，会有如下提示。如果通过工具合并也会有冲突提示，此时就需要人工介入解决冲突了。\n\n2，本地分支与远端分支冲突\n这种一般出现在多人在同一个分支上协作开发的场景。\n比如张三从远端仓库拿到代码后，对文件b.cpp进行了修改。然后push到远端仓库。\n李四在张三之前就拿到了中心仓库的代码，在张三push成功之后也对b.cpp文件进行了修改。这个时候李四也运行push命令推送代码。此时就会提示冲突。\n需要人工介入解决冲突了。\n\n1.14.2. 2.16.2    冲突解决\n1，手工解决冲突方法1\n在文本编辑器或IDE里打开这个文件，就会看到这样的文件内容：\n\nGit用>>>>>>标记出不同分支的内容，上面HEAD表示当前分支的代码，下面的master表示master分支的代码。此时我们需要确认需要留哪部分的代码或者需要合并后的结果，那么一定要手动处理完再提交，将不需要的部分删掉，切记！\n需要合并后的结果：\n\n手动解决冲突方法2\n建议本地下载一份完整的master代码或远端库上分支代码，与本地分支做BCompare用\n发生冲突时，更新最新的master或远端库上分支代码，与本地分支作比较。\n1）如果是不需要逻辑处理的冲突，只需将自己的修改部分按照方法1中的方式与库上代码merge即可。\n2）如果冲突的代码需要做逻辑处理，例如需要添加分支处理等，则需要把本地修改先做另存，将库上代码重新pull，再将另存的代码合入。以确保库上冲突代码先下拉至本地分支，再合入自己的代码，即维持git合入的时序性。\n解决完冲突后，再按照之前提交的步骤，git add ，git commit，git push提交到服务器就可以了。\n在codeclub上的merge request不需要重新提交，在git push之后会重新启动编译。\n1.14.3. 2.16.3    执行git pull –rebase的必要性及冲突解决\n在有些资料中看到git pull –rebase看这个命令，都说很神奇。这里推荐大家尝试使用。在git push之前执行git pull –rebase，经远端分支上的最新代码同步到本地\ngit pull --rebase = git fetch + git rebase\n如果出现冲突，需采用2.16.2节中的解决方法。并且在解决冲突之后，用git add命令去更新这些内容，然后不用执行git-commit,直接执行git rebase --continue,这样git会继续apply余下的补丁。\n在任何时候，都可以用git rebase --abort参数来终止rebase的行动，并且分支会回到rebase开始前的状态。\n"},"doc/k8s.html":{"url":"doc/k8s.html","title":"K 8 S","keywords":"","body":"1.1. k8s 组件1.2. 简述

kube-scheduler\n    kube-controller-manager\n    cloud-controller-manager\nNode 组件\n    kubelet\n    kube-proxy\n    容器运行时（Container Runtime）\n1.2. 简述 Kubernetes 相关基础概念？\n\nmaster：k8s 集群的管理节点，负责管理集群，提供集群的资源数据访问入口。拥有 Etcd 存储服务（可选），运行 Api Server 进程，Controller Manager 服务进程及 Scheduler 服务进程。\nnode（worker）：Node（worker）是 Kubernetes 集群架构中运行 Pod 的服务节点，是 Kubernetes 集群操作的单元，用来承载被分配 Pod 的运行，是 Pod 运行的宿主机。运行 docker eninge 服务，守护进程 kunelet 及负载均衡器 kube-proxy。 \npod：运行于 Node 节点上，若干相关容器的组合。Pod 内包含的容器运行在同一宿主机上，使用相同的网络命名空间、IP 地址和端口，能够通过localhost 进行通信。 Pod 是 Kurbernetes 进行创建、调度和管理的最小单位，它提供了比容器更高层次的抽象，使得部署和管理更加灵活。一个 Pod 可以包含一个容器或者多个相关容器。 \nlabel：Kubernetes 中的Label 实质是一系列的 Key/Value 键值对，其中 key 与 value 可自定义。Label 可以附加到各种资源对象上，如 Node、Pod、Service、RC 等。一个资源对象可以定义任意数量的 Label，同一个Label 也可以被添加到任意数量的资源对象上去。Kubernetes 通过 Label Selector（标签选择器）查询和筛选资源对象。 \nReplication Controller: 用来管理 Pod 的副本，保证集群中存在指定数量的 Pod 副本。集群中副本的数量大于指定数量，则会停止指定数量之外的多余容器数量。反之，则会启动少于指定数量个数的容器，保证数量不变。Replication Controller是实现弹性伸缩、动态扩容和滚动升级的核心。 Deployment：Deployment 在内部使用了 RS 来实现目的，Deployment 相当于 RC 的一次升级，其最大的特色为可以随时获知当前 Pod 的部署进度。\n\nHPA（Horizontal Pod Autoscaler）：Pod 的横向自动扩容，也是 Kubernetes 的一种资源，通过追踪分析 RC 控制的所有 Pod 目标的负载变化情况，来确定是否需要针对性的调整 Pod 副本数量。\n\nService：Service 定义了 Pod 的逻辑集合和访问该集合的策略，是真实服务的抽象。Service 提供了一个统一的服务访问入口以及服务代理和发现机制，关联多个相同 Label 的 Pod，用户不需要了解后台 Pod是如何运行。 Volume：Volume 是 Pod 中能够被多个容器访问的共享目录，Kubernetes 中的 Volume 是定义在 Pod 上，可以被一个或多个 Pod 中的容器挂载到某个目录下。\nNamespace：Namespace 用于实现多租户的资源隔离，可将集群内部的资源对象分配到不同的 Namespace 中，形成逻辑上的不同项目、小组或用户组，便于不同的 Namespace 在共享使用整个集群的资源的同时还能被分别管理。\n\n1.3. 简述 Kubernetes 集群相关组件？\nKubernetes Master 控制组件，调度管理整个系统（集群），包含如下组件:\n\nKubernetes API Server：作为 Kubernetes 系统的入口，其封装了核心对象的增删改查操作，以 RESTful API 接口方式提供给外部客户和内部组件调用，集群内各个功能模块之间数据交互和通信的中心枢纽。 \nKubernetes Scheduler：为新建立的 Pod 进行节点(node)选择(即分配机器)，负责集群的资源调度。 \nKubernetes Controller：负责执行各种控制器，目前已经提供了很多控制器来保证 Kubernetes 的正常运行。\nReplication Controller：管理维护 Replication Controller，关联 Replication Controller 和 - Pod，保证 Replication Controller 定义的副本数量与实际运行 Pod 数量一致。\nNode Controller：管理维护 Node，定期检查 Node 的健康状态，标识出(失效|未失效)的 Node 节点。\nNamespace Controller：管理维护 Namespace，定期清理无效的 Namespace，包括 Namesapce 下的 API 对象，比如 Pod、Service 等。\nService Controller：管理维护 Service，提供负载以及服务代理。\nEndPoints Controller：管理维护 Endpoints，关联 Service 和 Pod，创建 Endpoints 为 Service 的后端，当 Pod 发生变化时，实时更新 Endpoints。\nService Account Controller：管理维护 Service Account，为每个 Namespace 创建默认的 Service Account，同时为 Service Account 创建 Service Account Secret。\nPersistent Volume Controller：管理维护 Persistent Volume 和 Persistent Volume Claim，为新的 Persistent Volume Claim 分配 Persistent Volume 进行绑定，为释放的 Persistent Volume 执行清理回收。\nDaemon Set Controller：管理维护 Daemon Set，负责创建 Daemon Pod，保证指定的 Node 上正常的运行 Daemon Pod。\nDeployment Controller：管理维护 Deployment，关联 Deployment 和 Replication Controller，保证运行指定数量的 Pod。当 Deployment 更新时，控制实现 Replication Controller 和 Pod 的更新。\nJob Controller：管理维护 Job，为 Jod 创建一次性任务 Pod，保证完成 Job 指定完成的任务数目\nPod Autoscaler Controller：实现 Pod 的自动伸缩，定时获取监控数据，进行策略匹配，当满足条件时执行 Pod 的伸缩动作。\n\n1.4. 简述 Kubernetes 创建一个 Pod 的主要流程？\nKubernetes 中创建一个 Pod 涉及多个组件之间联动，主要流程如下：\n\n客户端提交 Pod 的配置信息（可以是 yaml 文件定义的信息）到 kube-apiserver。\nApiserver 收到指令后，通知给 controller-manager 创建一个资源对象。\nController-manager 通过 api-server 将 pod 的配置信息存储到etcd 数据中心中。\nKube-scheduler 检测到 pod 信息会开始调度预选，会先过滤掉不符合 Pod 资源配置要求的节点，然后开始调度调优，主要是挑选出更适合运行 pod 的节点，然后将 pod 的资源配置单发送到 node 节点上的 kubelet 组件上。\nKubelet 根据 scheduler 发来的资源配置单运行 pod，运行成功后，将 pod 的运行信息返回给 scheduler，scheduler 将返回的 pod 运行状况的信息存储到 etcd 数据中心。\n\n1.5. 简述 Kubernetes 中 Pod 的重启策略？\nPod 重启策略（RestartPolicy）应用于 Pod 内的所有容器，并且仅在 Pod 所处的 Node 上由 kubelet 进行判断和重启操作。当某个容器异常退出或者健康检查失败时，kubelet 将根据 RestartPolicy 的设置来进行相应操作。\nPod 的重启策略包括 Always、OnFailure 和 Never，默认值为 Always。 \n\nAlways：当容器失效时，由 kubelet 自动重启该容器； \nOnFailure：当容器终止运行且退出码不为 0 时，由 kubelet 自动重启该容器；\nNever：不论容器运行状态如何，kubelet 都不会重启该容器。\n\n同时 Pod 的重启策略与控制方式关联，当前可用于管理 Pod 的控制器包括 ReplicationController、Job、DaemonSet 及直接管理 kubelet 管理（静态 Pod）。\n不同控制器的重启策略限制如下：\n\nRC 和 DaemonSet：必须设置为 Always，需要保证该容器持续运行；\nJob：OnFailure 或 Never，确保容器执行完成后不再重启；\nkubelet：在 Pod 失效时重启，不论将 RestartPolicy 设置为何值，也不会对 Pod 进行健康检查。\n\n1.6. 简述 Kubernetes 中 Pod 的健康检查方式？\n对 Pod 的健康检查可以通过两类探针来检查：LivenessProbe 和 ReadinessProbe。\n\nLivenessProbe 探针：用于判断容器是否存活（running 状态），如果 LivenessProbe 探针探测到容器不健康，则 kubelet 将杀掉该容器，并根据容器的重启策略做相应处理。若一个容器不包含 LivenessProbe 探针，kubelet 认为该容器的 LivenessProbe 探针返回值用于是“Success”。\nReadineeProbe 探针：用于判断容器是否启动完成（ready 状态）。如果 ReadinessProbe 探针探测到失败，则 Pod 的状态将被修改。Endpoint Controller 将从 Service 的 Endpoint 中删除包含该容器所在 Pod 的 Eenpoint。\nstartupProbe 探针：启动检查机制，应用一些启动缓慢的业务，避免业务长时间启动而被上面两类探针 kill 掉。\n\n1.7. 简述 Kubernetes Pod 的 LivenessProbe 探针的常见方式？\nkubelet 定期执行 LivenessProbe 探针来诊断容器的健康状态，通常有以下三种方式：\n\nExecAction：在容器内执行一个命令，若返回码为 0，则表明容器健康。\nTCPSocketAction：通过容器的 IP 地址和端口号执行 TCP 检查，若能建立 TCP 连接，则表明容器健康。\nHTTPGetAction：通过容器的 IP 地址、端口号及路径调用 HTTP Get 方法，若响应的状态码大于等于 200 且小于 400，则表明容器健康。\n\n1.8. 简述 Kubernetes Pod 的常见调度方式？\nKubernetes 中，Pod 通常是容器的载体，主要有如下常见调度方式：\n\nDeployment 或 RC：该调度策略主要功能就是自动部署一个容器应用的多份副本，以及持续监控副本的数量，在集群内始终维持用户指定的副本数量。\nNodeSelector：定向调度，当需要手动指定将 Pod 调度到特定 Node 上，可以通过 Node 的标签（Label）和 Pod 的 nodeSelector 属性相匹配。\nNodeAffinity 亲和性调度：亲和性调度机制极大的扩展了 Pod 的调度能力，目前有两种节点亲和力表达：\n\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution：硬规则，必须满足指定的规则，调度器才可以调度 Pod 至 Node 上（类似 nodeSelector，语法不同）\npreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution：软规则，优先调度至满足的 Node 的节点，但不强求，多个优先级规则还可以设置权重值。\n\n\nTaints 和 Tolerations（污点和容忍）：\n\nTaint：使 Node 拒绝特定 Pod 运行；\nToleration：为 Pod 的属性，表示 Pod 能容忍（运行）标注了 Taint 的 Node。\n\n\n\n1.9. 简述 Kubernetes 初始化容器（init container）？\ninit container的运行方式与应用容器不同，它们必须先于应用容器执行完成，当设置了多个 init container 时，将按顺序逐个运行，并且只有前一个 init container 运行成功后才能运行后一个 init container。当所有 init container 都成功运行后，Kubernetes 才会初始化 Pod 的各种信息，并开始创建和运行应用容器。\n1.10. 简述 Kubernetes deployment 升级过程？\n\n初始创建 Deployment 时，系统创建了一个 ReplicaSet，并按用户的需求创建了对应数量的 Pod 副本。\n当更新 Deployment 时，系统创建了一个新的 ReplicaSet，并将其副本数量扩展到 1，然后将旧 ReplicaSet 缩减为 2。\n之后，系统继续按照相同的更新策略对新旧两个 ReplicaSet 进行逐个调整。\n最后，新的 ReplicaSet 运行了对应个新版本 Pod 副本，旧的 ReplicaSet 副本数量则缩减为 0。\n\n1.11. 简述 Kubernetes deployment 升级策略？\n在 Deployment 的定义中，可以通过 spec.strategy 指定 Pod 更新的策略，目前支持两种策略：Recreate（重建）和 RollingUpdate（滚动更新），默认值为 RollingUpdate。\n\nRecreate：设置 spec.strategy.type=Recreate，表示 Deployment 在更新 Pod 时，会先杀掉所有正在运行的 Pod，然后创建新的 Pod。\nRollingUpdate：设置 spec.strategy.type=RollingUpdate，表示 Deployment 会以滚动更新的方式来逐个更新 Pod。同时，可以通过设置 spec.strategy.rollingUpdate 下的两个参数（maxUnavailable 和 maxSurge）来控制滚动更新的过程。\n\n1.12. 简述 Kubernetes DaemonSet 类型的资源特性？\nDaemonSet 资源对象会在每个 Kubernetes 集群中的节点上运行，并且每个节点只能运行一个 pod，这是它和 deployment 资源对象的最大也是唯一的区别。\n因此，在定义 yaml 文件中，不支持定义 replicas。\n它的一般使用场景如下：\n\n在去做每个节点的日志收集工作。\n监控每个节点的的运行状态。\n\n1.13. 简述 Kubernetes 自动扩容机制？\nKubernetes 使用 Horizontal Pod Autoscaler（HPA）的控制器实现基于 CPU 使用率进行自动 Pod 扩缩容的功能。\nHPA 控制器周期性地监测目标 Pod 的资源性能指标，并与 HPA 资源对象中的扩缩容条件进行对比，在满足条件时对 Pod 副本数量进行调整。\nHPA 原理\nkubernetes 中的某个 Metrics Server（Heapster 或自定义 Metrics Server）持续采集所有 Pod 副本的指标数据。\nHPA 控制器通过 Metrics Server 的 API（Heapster 的 API 或聚合 API）获取这些数据，基于用户定义的扩缩容规则进行计算，得到目标 Pod 副本数量。\n当目标 Pod 副本数量与当前副本数量不同时，HPA 控制器就向 Pod 的副本控制器（Deployment、RC 或 ReplicaSet）发起 scale 操作，调整 Pod 的副本数量，完成扩缩容操作。\n1.14. 简述 Kubernetes Service 类型？\n通过创建 Service，可以为一组具有相同功能的容器应用提供一个统一的入口地址，并且将请求负载分发到后端的各个容器应用上。其主要类型有：\n\nClusterIP：虚拟的服务 IP 地址，该地址用于 Kubernetes 集群内部的 Pod 访问，在 Node 上 kube-proxy 通过设置的 iptables 规则进行转发；\nNodePort：使用宿主机的端口，使能够访问各 Node 的外部客户端通过 Node 的 IP 地址和端口号就能访问服务；\nLoadBalancer：使用外接负载均衡器完成到服务的负载分发，需要在 spec.status.loadBalancer 字段指定外部负载均衡器的 IP 地址，通常用于公有云。\n\n1.15. 简述 Kubernetes Service 分发后端的策略？\nService 负载分发的策略有：RoundRobin 和 SessionAffinity\n\nRoundRobin：默认为轮询模式，即轮询将请求转发到后端的各个 Pod 上。\nSessionAffinity：基于客户端 IP 地址进行会话保持的模式，即第 1 次将某个客户端发起的请求转发到后端的某个 Pod 上，之后从相同的客户端发起的请求都将被转发到后端相同的 Pod 上。\n\n1.16. 简述 Kubernetes 外部如何访问集群内的服务？\n对于 Kubernetes，集群外的客户端默认情况，无法通过 Pod 的 IP 地址或者 Service 的虚拟 IP 地址:虚拟端口号进行访问。\n通常可以通过以下方式进行访问 Kubernetes 集群内的服务：\n\n映射 Pod 到物理机：将 Pod 端口号映射到宿主机，即在 Pod 中采用 hostPort 方式，以使客户端应用能够通过物理机访问容器应用。\n映射 Service 到物理机：将 Service 端口号映射到宿主机，即在 Service 中采用 nodePort 方式，以使客户端应用能够通过物理机访问容器应用。\n映射 Sercie 到 LoadBalancer：通过设置 LoadBalancer 映射到云服务商提供的 LoadBalancer 地址。这种用法仅用于在公有云服务提供商的云平台上设置 Service 的场景。\n\n1.17. 简述 Kubernetes ingress？\nKubernetes 的 Ingress 资源对象，用于将不同 URL 的访问请求转发到后端不同的 Service，以实现 HTTP 层的业务路由机制。\nKubernetes 使用了 Ingress 策略和 Ingress Controller，两者结合并实现了一个完整的 Ingress 负载均衡器。\n使用 Ingress 进行负载分发时，Ingress Controller 基于 Ingress 规则将客户端请求直接转发到 Service 对应的后端 Endpoint（Pod）上，从而跳过 kube-proxy 的转发功能，kube-proxy 不再起作用，全过程为：ingress controller + ingress 规则 —-> services。\n同时当 Ingress Controller 提供的是对外服务，则实际上实现的是边缘路由器的功能。\n1.18. 简述 Kubernetes Scheduler 作用及实现原理？\nKubernetes Scheduler 是负责 Pod 调度的重要功能模块，Kubernetes Scheduler 在整个系统中承担了“承上启下”的重要功能，“承上”是指它负责接收 Controller Manager 创建的新 Pod，为其调度至目标 Node；“启下”是指调度完成后，目标 Node 上的 kubelet 服务进程接管后继工作，负责 Pod 接下来生命周期。\nKubernetes Scheduler 的作用是将待调度的 Pod（API 新创建的 Pod、Controller Manager 为补足副本而创建的 Pod 等）按照特定的调度算法和调度策略绑定（Binding）到集群中某个合适的 Node 上，并将绑定信息写入 etcd 中。\n在整个调度过程中涉及三个对象：\n分别是待调度 Pod 列表、可用 Node 列表，以及调度算法和策略。\nKubernetes Scheduler 通过调度算法调度为待调度 Pod 列表中的每个 Pod 从 Node 列表中选择一个最适合的 Node 来实现 Pod 的调度。\n随后，目标节点上的 kubelet 通过 API Server 监听到 Kubernetes Scheduler 产生的 Pod 绑定事件，然后获取对应的 Pod 清单，下载 Image 镜像并启动容器。\n1.19. 简述 Kubernetes Scheduler 使用哪两种算法将 Pod 绑定到 worker 节点？\nKubernetes Scheduler 根据如下两种调度算法将 Pod 绑定到最合适的工作节点：\n\n预选（Predicates）：输入是所有节点，输出是满足预选条件的节点。kube-scheduler 根据预选策略过滤掉不满足策略的 Nodes。如果某节点的资源不足或者不满足预选策略的条件则无法通过预选。如“Node 的 label 必须与 Pod 的 Selector 一致”。\n优选（Priorities）：输入是预选阶段筛选出的节点，优选会根据优先策略为通过预选的 Nodes 进行打分排名，选择得分最高的 Node。例如，资源越富裕、负载越小的 Node 可能具有越高的排名。\n\n"},"doc/re.html":{"url":"doc/re.html","title":"Re","keywords":"","body":"1. 元字符1.

Python语言特性\n1.1. 1 Python的函数参数传递\n看两个例子:\na = 1\ndef fun(a):\n    a = 2\nfun(a)\nprint(a)  # 1\n\na = []\ndef fun(a):\n    a.append(1)\nfun(a)\nprint a  # [1]\n\n所有的变量都可以理解是内存中一个对象的“引用”，或者，也可以看似c中void*的感觉。\n通过id来看引用a的内存地址可以比较理解：\na = 1\ndef fun(a):\n    print \"func_in\",id(a)   # func_in 41322472\n    a = 2\n    print \"re-point\",id(a), id(2)   # re-point 41322448 41322448\nprint \"func_out\",id(a), id(1)  # func_out 41322472 41322472\nfun(a)\nprint a  # 1\n\n注：具体的值在不同电脑上运行时可能不同。\n可以看到，在执行完a = 2之后，a引用中保存的值，即内存地址发生变化，由原来1对象的所在的地址变成了2这个实体对象的内存地址。\n而第2个例子a引用保存的内存值就不会发生变化：\na = []\ndef fun(a):\n    print \"func_in\",id(a)  # func_in 53629256\n    a.append(1)\nprint \"func_out\",id(a)     # func_out 53629256\nfun(a)\nprint a  # [1]\n\n这里记住的是类型是属于对象的，而不是变量。而对象有两种,“可更改”（mutable）与“不可更改”（immutable）对象。在python中，strings, tuples, 和numbers是不可更改的对象，而 list, dict, set 等则是可以修改的对象。(这就是这个问题的重点)\n当一个引用传递给函数的时候,函数自动复制一份引用,这个函数里的引用和外边的引用没有半毛关系了.所以第一个例子里函数把引用指向了一个不可变对象,当函数返回的时候,外面的引用没半毛感觉.而第二个例子就不一样了,函数内的引用指向的是可变对象,对它的操作就和定位了指针地址一样,在内存里进行修改.\n如果还不明白的话,这里有更好的解释: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/986006/how-do-i-pass-a-variable-by-reference\n1.2. 2 Python中的元类(metaclass)\n这个非常的不常用,但是像ORM这种复杂的结构还是会需要的,详情请看:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/100003/what-is-a-metaclass-in-python\n1.3. 3 @staticmethod和@classmethod\nPython其实有3个方法,即静态方法(staticmethod),类方法(classmethod)和实例方法,如下:\ndef foo(x):\n    print \"executing foo(%s)\"%(x)\n\nclass A(object):\n    def foo(self,x):\n        print \"executing foo(%s,%s)\"%(self,x)\n\n    @classmethod\n    def class_foo(cls,x):\n        print \"executing class_foo(%s,%s)\"%(cls,x)\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def static_foo(x):\n        print \"executing static_foo(%s)\"%x\n\na=A()\n\n这里先理解下函数参数里面的self和cls.这个self和cls是对类或者实例的绑定,对于一般的函数来说我们可以这么调用foo(x),这个函数就是最常用的,它的工作跟任何东西(类,实例)无关.对于实例方法,我们知道在类里每次定义方法的时候都需要绑定这个实例,就是foo(self, x),为什么要这么做呢?因为实例方法的调用离不开实例,我们需要把实例自己传给函数,调用的时候是这样的a.foo(x)(其实是foo(a, x)).类方法一样,只不过它传递的是类而不是实例,A.class_foo(x).注意这里的self和cls可以替换别的参数,但是python的约定是这俩,还是不要改的好.\n对于静态方法其实和普通的方法一样,不需要对谁进行绑定,唯一的区别是调用的时候需要使用a.static_foo(x)或者A.static_foo(x)来调用.\n\n\n\n\\\n实例方法\n类方法\n静态方法\n\n\n\n\na = A()\na.foo(x)\na.class_foo(x)\na.static_foo(x)\n\n\nA\n不可用\nA.class_foo(x)\nA.static_foo(x)\n\n\n\n更多关于这个问题:\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/what-is-the-difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod-in-python\nhttps://realpython.com/blog/python/instance-class-and-static-methods-demystified/1.4. 4 类变量和实例变量\n\n\n类变量：\n\n    是可在类的所有实例之间共享的值（也就是说，它们不是单独分配给每个实例的）。例如下例中，num_of_instance 就是类变量，用于跟踪存在着多少个Test 的实例。\n\n实例变量：\n\n实例化之后，每个实例单独拥有的变量。\n\nclass Test(object):  \n    num_of_instance = 0  \n

Python自省\n这个也是python彪悍的特性.\n自省就是面向对象的语言所写的程序在运行时,所能知道对象的类型.简单一句就是运行时能够获得对象的类型.比如type(),dir(),getattr(),hasattr(),isinstance().\na = [1,2,3]\nb = {'a':1,'b':2,'c':3}\nc = True\nprint type(a),type(b),type(c) #   \nprint isinstance(a,list)  # True\n\n1.6. 6 字典推导式\n可能你见过列表推导时,却没有见过字典推导式,在2.7中才加入的:\nd = {key: value for (key, value) in iterable}\n\n1.7. 7 Python中单下划线和双下划线\n>>> class MyClass():\n...     def __init__(self):\n...             self.__superprivate = \"Hello\"\n...             self._semiprivate = \", world!\"\n...\n>>> mc = MyClass()\n>>> print mc.__superprivate\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nAttributeError: myClass instance has no attribute '__superprivate'\n>>> print mc._semiprivate\n, world!\n>>> print mc.__dict__\n{'_MyClass__superprivate': 'Hello', '_semiprivate': ', world!'}\n\n__foo__:一种约定,Python内部的名字,用来区别其他用户自定义的命名,以防冲突，就是例如__init__(),__del__(),__call__()这些特殊方法\n_foo:一种约定,用来指定变量私有.程序员用来指定私有变量的一种方式.不能用from module import * 导入，其他方面和公有一样访问；\n__foo:这个有真正的意义:解析器用_classname__foo来代替这个名字,以区别和其他类相同的命名,它无法直接像公有成员一样随便访问,通过对象名._类名__xxx这样的方式可以访问.\n详情见:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1301346/the-meaning-of-a-single-and-a-double-underscore-before-an-object-name-in-python\n或者: http://www.zhihu.com/question/19754941\n1.8. 8 字符串格式化:%和.format\n.format在许多方面看起来更便利.对于%最烦人的是它无法同时传递一个变量和元组.你可能会想下面的代码不会有什么问题:\n\"hi there %s\" % name\n但是,如果name恰好是(1,2,3),它将会抛出一个TypeError异常.为了保证它总是正确的,你必须这样做:\n\"hi there %s\" % (name,)   # 提供一个单元素的数组而不是一个参数\n但是有点丑..format就没有这些问题.你给的第二个问题也是这样,.format好看多了.\n你为什么不用它?\n\n不知道它(在读这个之前)\n为了和Python2.5兼容(譬如logging库建议使用%(issue #4))\n\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/5082452/python-string-formatting-vs-format\n1.9. 9 迭代器和生成器\n这个是stackoverflow里python排名第一的问题,值得一看: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do-in-python\n这是中文版: http://taizilongxu.gitbooks.io/stackoverflow-about-python/content/1/README.html\n这里有个关于生成器的创建问题面试官有考：\n问：  将列表生成式中[]改成() 之后数据结构是否改变？\n答案：是，从列表变为生成器\n>>> L = [x*x for x in range(10)]\n>>> L\n[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n>>> g = (x*x for x in range(10))\n>>> g\n at 0x0000028F8B774200>\n\n通过列表生成式，可以直接创建一个列表。但是，受到内存限制，列表容量肯定是有限的。而且，创建一个包含百万元素的列表，不仅是占用很大的内存空间，如：我们只需要访问前面的几个元素，后面大部分元素所占的空间都是浪费的。因此，没有必要创建完整的列表（节省大量内存空间）。在Python中，我们可以采用生成器：边循环，边计算的机制—>generator\n1.10. 10 *args and **kwargs\n用*args和**kwargs只是为了方便并没有强制使用它们.\n当你不确定你的函数里将要传递多少参数时你可以用*args.例如,它可以传递任意数量的参数:\n>>> def print_everything(*args):\n        for count, thing in enumerate(args):\n...         print '{0}. {1}'.format(count, thing)\n...\n>>> print_everything('apple', 'banana', 'cabbage')\n0. apple\n1. banana\n2. cabbage\n\n相似的,**kwargs允许你使用没有事先定义的参数名:\n>>> def table_things(**kwargs):\n...     for name, value in kwargs.items():\n...         print '{0} = {1}'.format(name, value)\n...\n>>> table_things(apple = 'fruit', cabbage = 'vegetable')\ncabbage = vegetable\napple = fruit\n\n你也可以混着用.命名参数首先获得参数值然后所有的其他参数都传递给*args和**kwargs.命名参数在列表的最前端.例如:\ndef table_things(titlestring, **kwargs)\n*args和**kwargs可以同时在函数的定义中,但是*args必须在**kwargs前面.\n当调用函数时你也可以用*和**语法.例如:\n>>> def print_three_things(a, b, c):\n...     print 'a = {0}, b = {1}, c = {2}'.format(a,b,c)\n...\n>>> mylist = ['aardvark', 'baboon', 'cat']\n>>> print_three_things(*mylist)\n\na = aardvark, b = baboon, c = cat\n\n就像你看到的一样,它可以传递列表(或者元组)的每一项并把它们解包.注意必须与它们在函数里的参数相吻合.当然,你也可以在函数定义或者函数调用时用*.\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/3394835/args-and-kwargs\n1.11. 11 面向切面编程AOP和装饰器\n这个AOP一听起来有点懵,同学面阿里的时候就被问懵了...\n装饰器是一个很著名的设计模式，经常被用于有切面需求的场景，较为经典的有插入日志、性能测试、事务处理等。装饰器是解决这类问题的绝佳设计，有了装饰器，我们就可以抽离出大量函数中与函数功能本身无关的雷同代码并继续重用。概括的讲，装饰器的作用就是为已经存在的对象添加额外的功能。\n这个问题比较大,推荐: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/739654/how-can-i-make-a-chain-of-function-decorators-in-python\n中文: http://taizilongxu.gitbooks.io/stackoverflow-about-python/content/3/README.html\n1.12. 12 鸭子类型\n“当看到一只鸟走起来像鸭子、游泳起来像鸭子、叫起来也像鸭子，那么这只鸟就可以被称为鸭子。”\n我们并不关心对象是什么类型，到底是不是鸭子，只关心行为。\n比如在python中，有很多file-like的东西，比如StringIO,GzipFile,socket。它们有很多相同的方法，我们把它们当作文件使用。\n又比如list.extend()方法中,我们并不关心它的参数是不是list,只要它是可迭代的,所以它的参数可以是list/tuple/dict/字符串/生成器等.\n鸭子类型在动态语言中经常使用，非常灵活，使得python不像java那样专门去弄一大堆的设计模式。\n1.13. 13 Python中重载\n引自知乎:http://www.zhihu.com/question/20053359\n函数重载主要是为了解决两个问题。\n\n可变参数类型。\n可变参数个数。\n\n另外，一个基本的设计原则是，仅仅当两个函数除了参数类型和参数个数不同以外，其功能是完全相同的，此时才使用函数重载，如果两个函数的功能其实不同，那么不应当使用重载，而应当使用一个名字不同的函数。\n好吧，那么对于情况 1 ，函数功能相同，但是参数类型不同，python 如何处理？答案是根本不需要处理，因为 python 可以接受任何类型的参数，如果函数的功能相同，那么不同的参数类型在 python 中很可能是相同的代码，没有必要做成两个不同函数。\n那么对于情况 2 ，函数功能相同，但参数个数不同，python 如何处理？大家知道，答案就是缺省参数。对那些缺少的参数设定为缺省参数即可解决问题。因为你假设函数功能相同，那么那些缺少的参数终归是需要用的。\n好了，鉴于情况 1 跟 情况 2 都有了解决方案，python 自然就不需要函数重载了。\n1.14. 14 新式类和旧式类\n这个面试官问了,我说了老半天,不知道他问的真正意图是什么.\nstackoverflow\n这篇文章很好的介绍了新式类的特性: http://www.cnblogs.com/btchenguang/archive/2012/09/17/2689146.html\n新式类很早在2.2就出现了,所以旧式类完全是兼容的问题,Python3里的类全部都是新式类.这里有一个MRO问题可以了解下(新式类继承是根据C3算法,旧式类是深度优先),里讲的也很多.\n\n一个旧式类的深度优先的例子\n\nclass A():\n    def foo1(self):\n        print \"A\"\nclass B(A):\n    def foo2(self):\n        pass\nclass C(A):\n    def foo1(self):\n        print \"C\"\nclass D(B, C):\n    pass\n\nd = D()\nd.foo1()\n\n# A\n\n按照经典类的查找顺序从左到右深度优先的规则，在访问d.foo1()的时候,D这个类是没有的..那么往上查找,先找到B,里面没有,深度优先,访问A,找到了foo1(),所以这时候调用的是A的foo1()，从而导致C重写的foo1()被绕过\n1.15. 15 __new__和__init__的区别\n这个__new__确实很少见到,先做了解吧.\n\n__new__是一个静态方法,而__init__是一个实例方法.\n__new__方法会返回一个创建的实例,而__init__什么都不返回.\n只有在__new__返回一个cls的实例时后面的__init__才能被调用.\n当创建一个新实例时调用__new__,初始化一个实例时用__init__.\n\nstackoverflow\nps: __metaclass__是创建类时起作用.所以我们可以分别使用__metaclass__,__new__和__init__来分别在类创建,实例创建和实例初始化的时候做一些小手脚.\n1.16. 16 单例模式\n\n    单例模式是一种常用的软件设计模式。在它的核心结构中只包含一个被称为单例类的特殊类。通过单例模式可以保证系统中一个类只有一个实例而且该实例易于外界访问，从而方便对实例个数的控制并节约系统资源。如果希望在系统中某个类的对象只能存在一个，单例模式是最好的解决方案。\n\n`__new__()`在`__init__()`之前被调用，用于生成实例对象。利用这个方法和类的属性的特点可以实现设计模式的单例模式。单例模式是指创建唯一对象，单例模式设计的类只能实例\n**这个绝对常考啊.绝对要记住1~2个方法,当时面试官是让手写的.**\n\n1.16.1. 1 使用__new__方法\nclass Singleton(object):\n    def __new__(cls, *args, **kw):\n        if not hasattr(cls, '_instance'):\n            orig = super(Singleton, cls)\n            cls._instance = orig.__new__(cls, *args, **kw)\n        return cls._instance\n\nclass MyClass(Singleton):\n    a = 1\n\n1.16.2. 2 共享属性\n创建实例时把所有实例的__dict__指向同一个字典,这样它们具有相同的属性和方法.\n\nclass Borg(object):\n    _state =

装饰器版本\ndef singleton(cls):\n    instances = {}\n    def getinstance(*args, **kw):\n        if cls not in instances:\n            instances[cls] = cls(*args, **kw)\n        return instances[cls]\n

My_Singleton()\n\n# to use\nfrom mysingleton import my_singleton\n\nmy_singleton.foo()\n\n单例模式伯乐在线详细解释\n1.17. 17 Python中的作用域\nPython 中，一个变量的作用域总是由在代码中被赋值的地方所决定的。\n当 Python 遇到一个变量的话他会按照这样的顺序进行搜索：\n本地作用域（Local）→当前作用域被嵌入的本地作用域（Enclosing locals）→全局/模块作用域（Global）→内置作用域（Built-in）\n1.18. 18 GIL线程全局锁\n线程全局锁(Global Interpreter Lock),即Python为了保证线程安全而采取的独立线程运行的限制,说白了就是一个核只能在同一时间运行一个线程.对于io密集型任务，python的多线程起到作用，但对于cpu密集型任务，python的多线程几乎占不到任何优势，还有可能因为争夺资源而变慢。\n见Python 最难的问题\n解决办法就是多进程和下面的协程(协程也只是单CPU,但是能减小切换代价提升性能).\n1.19. 19 协程\n知乎被问到了,呵呵哒,跪了\n简单点说协程是进程和线程的升级版,进程和线程都面临着内核态和用户态的切换问题而耗费许多切换时间,而协程就是用户自己控制切换的时机,不再需要陷入系统的内核态.\nPython里最常见的yield就是协程的思想!可以查看第九个问题.\n1.20. 20 闭包\n闭包(closure)是函数式编程的重要的语法结构。闭包也是一种组织代码的结构，它同样提高了代码的可重复使用性。\n当一个内嵌函数引用其外部作作用域的变量,我们就会得到一个闭包. 总结一下,创建一个闭包必须满足以下几点:\n\n必须有一个内嵌函数\n内嵌函数必须引用外部函数中的变量\n外部函数的返回值必须是内嵌函数\n\n感觉闭包还是有难度的,几句话是说不明白的,还是查查相关资料.\n重点是函数运行后并不会被撤销,就像16题的instance字典一样,当函数运行完后,instance并不被销毁,而是继续留在内存空间里.这个功能类似类里的类变量,只不过迁移到了函数上.\n闭包就像个空心球一样,你知道外面和里面,但你不知道中间是什么样.\n1.21. 21 lambda函数\n其实就是一个匿名函数,为什么叫lambda?因为和后面的函数式编程有关.\n推荐: 知乎\n1.22. 22 Python函数式编程\n这个需要适当的了解一下吧,毕竟函数式编程在Python中也做了引用.\n推荐: 酷壳\npython中函数式编程支持:\nfilter 函数的功能相当于过滤器。调用一个布尔函数bool_func来迭代遍历每个seq中的元素；返回一个使bool_seq返回值为true的元素的序列。\n>>>a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]\n>>>b = filter(lambda x: x > 5, a)\n>>>print b\n>>>[6,7]\n\nmap函数是对一个序列的每个项依次执行函数，下面是对一个序列每个项都乘以2：\n>>> a = map(lambda x:x*2,[1,2,3])\n>>> list(a)\n[2, 4, 6]\n\nreduce函数是对一个序列的每个项迭代调用函数，下面是求3的阶乘：\n>>> reduce(lambda x,y:x*y,range(1,4))\n6\n\n1.23. 23 Python里的拷贝\n引用和copy(),deepcopy()的区别\nimport copy\na = [1, 2, 3, 4, ['a', 'b']]  #原始对象\n\nb = a  #赋值，传对象的引用\nc = copy.copy(a)  #对象拷贝，浅拷贝\nd = copy.deepcopy(a)  #对象拷贝，深拷贝\n\na.append(5)  #修改对象a\na[4].append('c')  #修改对象a中的['a', 'b']数组对象\n\nprint 'a = ', a\nprint 'b = ', b\nprint 'c = ', c\nprint 'd = ', d\n\n输出结果：\na =  [1, 2, 3, 4, ['a', 'b', 'c'], 5]\nb =  [1, 2, 3, 4, ['a', 'b', 'c'], 5]\nc =  [1, 2, 3, 4, ['a', 'b', 'c']]\nd =  [1, 2, 3, 4, ['a', 'b']]\n\n1.24. 24 Python垃圾回收机制\nPython GC主要使用引用计数（reference counting）来跟踪和回收垃圾。在引用计数的基础上，通过“标记-清除”（mark and sweep）解决容器对象可能产生的循环引用问题，通过“分代回收”（generation collection）以空间换时间的方法提高垃圾回收效率。\n1.24.1. 1 引用计数\nPyObject是每个对象必有的内容，其中ob_refcnt就是做为引用计数。当一个对象有新的引用时，它的ob_refcnt就会增加，当引用它的对象被删除，它的ob_refcnt就会减少.引用计数为0时，该对象生命就结束了。\n优点:\n\n简单\n实时性\n\n缺点:\n\n维护引用计数消耗资源\n循环引用\n\n1.24.2. 2 标记-清除机制\n基本思路是先按需分配，等到没有空闲内存的时候从寄存器和程序栈上的引用出发，遍历以对象为节点、以引用为边构成的图，把所有可以访问到的对象打上标记，然后清扫一遍内存空间，把所有没标记的对象释放。\n1.24.3. 3 分代技术\n分代回收的整体思想是：将系统中的所有内存块根据其存活时间划分为不同的集合，每个集合就成为一个“代”，垃圾收集频率随着“代”的存活时间的增大而减小，存活时间通常利用经过几次垃圾回收来度量。\nPython默认定义了三代对象集合，索引数越大，对象存活时间越长。\n举例：\n当某些内存块M经过了3次垃圾收集的清洗之后还存活时，我们就将内存块M划到一个集合A中去，而新分配的内存都划分到集合B中去。当垃圾收集开始工作时，大多数情况都只对集合B进行垃圾回收，而对集合A进行垃圾回收要隔相当长一段时间后才进行，这就使得垃圾收集机制需要处理的内存少了，效率自然就提高了。在这个过程中，集合B中的某些内存块由于存活时间长而会被转移到集合A中，当然，集合A中实际上也存在一些垃圾，这些垃圾的回收会因为这种分代的机制而被延迟。\n1.25.

But the main advantage comes with multiple inheritance, where all sorts of fun stuff can happen.

Redis是什么？\n\n是一个完全开源免费的key-value内存数据库\n通常被认为是一个数据结构服务器，主要是因为其有着丰富的数据结构 strings、map、 list、sets、 sorted sets\n\n3.3.2. Redis数据库\n\n    通常局限点来说，Redis也以消息队列的形式存在，作为内嵌的List存在，满足实时的高并发需求。在使用缓存的时候，redis比memcached具有更多的优势，并且支持更多的数据类型，把redis当作一个中间存储系统，用来处理高并发的数据库操作\n\n\n速度快：使用标准C写，所有数据都在内存中完成，读写速度分别达到10万/20万\n持久化：对数据的更新采用Copy-on-write技术，可以异步地保存到磁盘上，主要有两种策略，一是根据时间，更新次数的快照（save 300 10 ）二是基于语句追加方式(Append-only file，aof)\n自动操作：对不同数据类型的操作都是自动的，很安全\n快速的主--从复制，官方提供了一个数据，Slave在21秒即完成了对Amazon网站10G key set的复制。\nSharding技术： 很容易将数据分布到多个Redis实例中，数据库的扩展是个永恒的话题，在关系型数据库中，主要是以添加硬件、以分区为主要技术形式的纵向扩展解决了很多的应用场景，但随着web2.0、移动互联网、云计算等应用的兴起，这种扩展模式已经不太适合了，所以近年来，像采用主从配置、数据库复制形式的，Sharding这种技术把负载分布到多个特理节点上去的横向扩展方式用处越来越多。\n\n3.3.3. Redis缺点\n\n是数据库容量受到物理内存的限制,不能用作海量数据的高性能读写,因此Redis适合的场景主要局限在较小数据量的高性能操作和运算上。\nRedis较难支持在线扩容，在集群容量达到上限时在线扩容会变得很复杂。为避免这一问题，运维人员在系统上线时必须确保有足够的空间，这对资源造成了很大的浪费。\n\n3.4. 4 乐观锁和悲观锁\n悲观锁：假定会发生并发冲突，屏蔽一切可能违反数据完整性的操作\n乐观锁：假设不会发生并发冲突，只在提交操作时检查是否违反数据完整性。\n乐观锁与悲观锁的具体区别: http://www.cnblogs.com/Bob-FD/p/3352216.html\n3.5. 5 MVCC\n\n    全称是Multi-Version Concurrent Control，即多版本并发控制，在MVCC协议下，每个读操作会看到一个一致性的snapshot，并且可以实现非阻塞的读。MVCC允许数据具有多个版本，这个版本可以是时间戳或者是全局递增的事务ID，在同一个时间点，不同的事务看到的数据是不同的。\n\n3.5.1. MySQL的innodb引擎是如何实现MVCC的\ninnodb会为每一行添加两个字段，分别表示该行创建的版本和删除的版本，填入的是事务的版本号，这个版本号随着事务的创建不断递增。在repeated read的隔离级别（事务的隔离级别请看这篇文章）下，具体各种数据库操作的实现：\n\nselect：满足以下两个条件innodb会返回该行数据：\n该行的创建版本号小于等于当前版本号，用于保证在select操作之前所有的操作已经执行落地。\n该行的删除版本号大于当前版本或者为空。删除版本号大于当前版本意味着有一个并发事务将该行删除了。\n\n\ninsert：将新插入的行的创建版本号设置为当前系统的版本号。\ndelete：将要删除的行的删除版本号设置为当前系统的版本号。\nupdate：不执行原地update，而是转换成insert + delete。将旧行的删除版本号设置为当前版本号，并将新行insert同时设置创建版本号为当前版本号。\n\n其中，写操作（insert、delete和update）执行时，需要将系统版本号递增。\n由于旧数据并不真正的删除，所以必须对这些数据进行清理，innodb会开启一个后台线程执行清理工作，具体的规则是将删除版本号小于当前系统版本的行删除，这个过程叫做purge。\n通过MVCC很好的实现了事务的隔离性，可以达到repeated read级别，要实现serializable还必须加锁。\n\n 参考：MVCC浅析\n\n3.6. 6 MyISAM和InnoDB\nMyISAM 适合于一些需要大量查询的应用，但其对于有大量写操作并不是很好。甚至你只是需要update一个字段，整个表都会被锁起来，而别的进程，就算是读进程都无法操作直到读操作完成。另外，MyISAM 对于 SELECT COUNT(*) 这类的计算是超快无比的。\nInnoDB 的趋势会是一个非常复杂的存储引擎，对于一些小的应用，它会比 MyISAM 还慢。他是它支持“行锁” ，于是在写操作比较多的时候，会更优秀。并且，他还支持更多的高级应用，比如：事务。\nmysql 数据库引擎: http://www.cnblogs.com/0201zcr/p/5296843.html\nMySQL存储引擎－－MyISAM与InnoDB区别:

返回 ACK = 1 的报文确认, 为了防止服务器端未收到需要重发, 进入 TIME-WAIT 状态. 服务器接收到报文后关闭连接. 客户端等待 2MSL 后未收到回复, 则认为服务器成功关闭, 客户端关闭连接.\n\n图解: http://blog.csdn.net/whuslei/article/details/6667471\n4.3. 3 ARP协议\n地址解析协议(Address

Idempotence\nHTTP方法的幂等性是指一次和多次请求某一个资源应该具有同样的副作用。(注意是副作用)\nGET http://www.bank.com/account/123456，不会改变资源的状态，不论调用一次还是N次都没有副作用。请注意，这里强调的是一次和N次具有相同的副作用，而不是每次GET的结果相同。GET http://www.news.com/latest-news这个HTTP请求可能会每次得到不同的结果，但它本身并没有产生任何副作用，因而是满足幂等性的。\nDELETE方法用于删除资源，有副作用，但它应该满足幂等性。比如：DELETE http://www.forum.com/article/4231，调用一次和N次对系统产生的副作用是相同的，即删掉id为4231的帖子；因此，调用者可以多次调用或刷新页面而不必担心引起错误。\nPOST所对应的URI并非创建的资源本身，而是资源的接收者。比如：POST http://www.forum.com/articles的语义是在http://www.forum.com/articles下创建一篇帖子，HTTP响应中应包含帖子的创建状态以及帖子的URI。两次相同的POST请求会在服务器端创建两份资源，它们具有不同的URI；所以，POST方法不具备幂等性。\nPUT所对应的URI是要创建或更新的资源本身。比如：PUT http://www.forum/articles/4231的语义是创建或更新ID为4231的帖子。对同一URI进行多次PUT的副作用和一次PUT是相同的；因此，PUT方法具有幂等性。\n4.12. 12 RESTful架构(SOAP,RPC)\n推荐: http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2011/09/restful.html\n4.13. 13 SOAP\nSOAP（原为Simple Object Access Protocol的首字母缩写，即简单对象访问协议）是交换数据的一种协议规范，使用在计算机网络Web服务（web service）中，交换带结构信息。SOAP为了简化网页服务器（Web Server）从XML数据库中提取数据时，节省去格式化页面时间，以及不同应用程序之间按照HTTP通信协议，遵从XML格式执行资料互换，使其抽象于语言实现、平台和硬件。\n4.14. 14 RPC\nRPC（Remote Procedure Call Protocol）——远程过程调用协议，它是一种通过网络从远程计算机程序上请求服务，而不需要了解底层网络技术的协议。RPC协议假定某些传输协议的存在，如TCP或UDP，为通信程序之间携带信息数据。在OSI网络通信模型中，RPC跨越了传输层和应用层。RPC使得开发包括网络分布式多程序在内的应用程序更加容易。\n总结:服务提供的两大流派.传统意义以方法调用为导向通称RPC。为了企业SOA,若干厂商联合推出webservice,制定了wsdl接口定义,传输soap.当互联网时代,臃肿SOA被简化为http+xml/json.但是简化出现各种混乱。以资源为导向,任何操作无非是对资源的增删改查，于是统一的REST出现了.\n进化的顺序: RPC -> SOAP -> RESTful\n4.15. 15 CGI和WSGI\nCGI是通用网关接口，是连接web服务器和应用程序的接口，用户通过CGI来获取动态数据或文件等。\nCGI程序是一个独立的程序，它可以用几乎所有语言来写，包括perl，c，lua，python等等。\nWSGI, Web Server Gateway Interface，是Python应用程序或框架和Web服务器之间的一种接口，WSGI的其中一个目的就是让用户可以用统一的语言(Python)编写前后端。\n官方说明：PEP-3333\n4.16. 16 中间人攻击\n在GFW里屡见不鲜的,呵呵.\n中间人攻击（Man-in-the-middle attack，通常缩写为MITM）是指攻击者与通讯的两端分别创建独立的联系，并交换其所收到的数据，使通讯的两端认为他们正在通过一个私密的连接与对方直接对话，但事实上整个会话都被攻击者完全控制。\n4.17. 17 c10k问题\n所谓c10k问题，指的是服务器同时支持成千上万个客户端的问题，也就是concurrent 10 000 connection（这也是c10k这个名字的由来）。\n推荐:

向指定资源提交数据，请求服务器进行处理，如：表单数据提交、文件上传等，请求数据会被包含在请求体中。POST方法是非幂等的方法，因为这个请求可能会创建新的资源或/和修改现有资源。\nPUT\nPUT请求会身向指定资源位置上传其最新内容，PUT方法是幂等的方法。通过该方法客户端可以将指定资源的最新数据传送给服务器取代指定的资源的内容。\nDELETE\nDELETE请求用于请求服务器删除所请求URI（统一资源标识符，Uniform Resource Identifier）所标识的资源。DELETE请求后指定资源会被删除，DELETE方法也是幂等的。\nCONNECT\nCONNECT方法是HTTP/1.1协议预留的，能够将连接改为管道方式的代理服务器。通常用于SSL加密服务器的链接与非加密的HTTP代理服务器的通信。\nOPTIONS\nOPTIONS请求与HEAD类似，一般也是用于客户端查看服务器的性能。 这个方法会请求服务器返回该资源所支持的所有HTTP请求方法，该方法会用’*’来代替资源名称，向服务器发送OPTIONS请求，可以测试服务器功能是否正常。JavaScript的XMLHttpRequest对象进行CORS跨域资源共享时，就是使用OPTIONS方法发送嗅探请求，以判断是否有对指定资源的访问权限。 允许\nTRACE\nTRACE请求服务器回显其收到的请求信息，该方法主要用于HTTP请求的测试或诊断。\nHTTP/1.1之后增加的方法\n在HTTP/1.1标准制定之后，又陆续扩展了一些方法。其中使用中较多的是 PATCH 方法：\nPATCH\nPATCH方法出现的较晚，它在2010年的RFC 5789标准中被定义。PATCH请求与PUT请求类似，同样用于资源的更新。二者有以下两点不同：\n但PATCH一般用于资源的部分更新，而PUT一般用于资源的整体更新。\n当资源不存在时，PATCH会创建一个新的资源，而PUT只会对已在资源进行更新。\n4.21. 21 Ajax\nAJAX,Asynchronous JavaScript and XML（异步的 JavaScript 和 XML）, 是与在不重新加载整个页面的情况下，与服务器交换数据并更新部分网页的技术。\n5. *NIX\n5.1. unix进程间通信方式(IPC)\n\n管道（Pipe）：管道可用于具有亲缘关系进程间的通信，允许一个进程和另一个与它有共同祖先的进程之间进行通信。\n命名管道（named pipe）：命名管道克服了管道没有名字的限制，因此，除具有管道所具有的功能外，它还允许无亲缘关系进程间的通信。命名管道在文件系统中有对应的文件名。命名管道通过命令mkfifo或系统调用mkfifo来创建。\n信号（Signal）：信号是比较复杂的通信方式，用于通知接受进程有某种事件发生，除了用于进程间通信外，进程还可以发送信号给进程本身；linux除了支持Unix早期信号语义函数sigal外，还支持语义符合Posix.1标准的信号函数sigaction（实际上，该函数是基于BSD的，BSD为了实现可靠信号机制，又能够统一对外接口，用sigaction函数重新实现了signal函数）。\n消息（Message）队列：消息队列是消息的链接表，包括Posix消息队列system V消息队列。有足够权限的进程可以向队列中添加消息，被赋予读权限的进程则可以读走队列中的消息。消息队列克服了信号承载信息量少，管道只能承载无格式字节流以及缓冲区大小受限等缺\n共享内存：使得多个进程可以访问同一块内存空间，是最快的可用IPC形式。是针对其他通信机制运行效率较低而设计的。往往与其它通信机制，如信号量结合使用，来达到进程间的同步及互斥。\n内存映射（mapped memory）：内存映射允许任何多个进程间通信，每一个使用该机制的进程通过把一个共享的文件映射到自己的进程地址空间来实现它。\n信号量（semaphore）：主要作为进程间以及同一进程不同线程之间的同步手段。\n套接口（Socket）：更为一般的进程间通信机制，可用于不同机器之间的进程间通信。起初是由Unix系统的BSD分支开发出来的，但现在一般可以移植到其它类Unix系统上：Linux和System V的变种都支持套接字。\n\n6. 数据结构\n6.1. 1 红黑树\n红黑树与AVL的比较：\nAVL是严格平衡树，因此在增加或者删除节点的时候，根据不同情况，旋转的次数比红黑树要多；\n红黑是用非严格的平衡来换取增删节点时候旋转次数的降低；\n所以简单说，如果你的应用中，搜索的次数远远大于插入和删除，那么选择AVL，如果搜索，插入删除次数几乎差不多，应该选择RB。\n红黑树详解:

Bash also incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells\n       (ksh and csh).\n\n       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard 1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by\n       default.\n\nOPTIONS\n       All  of  the single-character shell options documented in the description of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as options when the shell is invoked.  In addition, bash inter‐\n       prets the following options when it is invoked:\n\n       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.  If there are arguments after the command_string, the first  argument  is  as‐\n                 signed to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment to $0 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.\n       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.\n       -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).\n       -r        If the -r option is present, the shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).\n       -s        If  the  -s option is present, or if no arguments remain after option processing, then commands are read from the standard input.  This option allows the positional parameters to be\n                 set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading input through a pipe.\n       -v        Print shell input lines as they are read.\n       -x        Print commands and their arguments as they are executed.\n       -D        A list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $ is printed on the standard output.  These are the strings that are subject to language translation when the current locale is not C\n                 or POSIX.  This implies the -n option; no commands will be executed.\n       [-+]O [shopt_option]\n                 shopt_option  is  one of the shell options accepted by the shopt builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  If shopt_option is present, -O sets the value of that option; +O unsets\n                 it.  If shopt_option is not supplied, the names and values of the shell options accepted by shopt are printed on the standard output.  If the invocation option is +O, the output  is\n                 displayed in a format that may be reused as input.\n       --        A -- signals the end of options and disables further option processing.  Any arguments after the -- are treated as filenames and arguments.  An argument of - is equivalent to --.\n\n       Bash also interprets a number of multi-character options.  These options must appear on the command line before the single-character options to be recognized.\n\n       --debugger\n              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).\n       --dump-po-strings\n              Equivalent to -D, but the output is in the GNU gettext po (portable object) file format.\n       --dump-strings\n              Equivalent to -D.\n       --help Display a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.\n       --init-file file\n       --rcfile file\n              Execute  commands from file instead of the system wide initialization file /etc/bash.bashrc and the standard personal initialization file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive (see IN‐\n              VOCATION below).\n\n       --login\n              Equivalent to -l.\n\n       --noediting\n              Do not use the GNU readline library to read command lines when the shell is interactive.\n\n       --noprofile\n              Do not read either the system-wide startup file /etc/profile or any of the personal initialization files ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile.  By default,  bash  reads  these\n              files when it is invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).\n\n       --norc Do  not  read and execute the system wide initialization file /etc/bash.bashrc and the personal initialization file ~/.bashrc if the shell is interactive.  This option is on by default\n              if the shell is invoked as sh.\n\n       --posix\n              Change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard (posix mode).  See SEE ALSO below for a reference to a document  that  de‐\n              tails how posix mode affects bash's behavior.\n\n       --restricted\n              The shell becomes restricted (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).\n\n       --verbose\n              Equivalent to -v.\n\n       --version\n              Show version information for this instance of bash on the standard output and exit successfully.\n\nARGUMENTS\n       If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the -c nor the -s option has been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing shell commands.  If bash\n       is invoked in this fashion, $0 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parameters are set to the remaining arguments.  Bash reads and executes commands from this file, then  exits.\n       Bash's exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the file in the current\n       directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell searches the directories in PATH for the script.\n\nINVOCATION\n       A login shell is one whose first character of argument zero is a -, or one started with the --login option.\n\n       An interactive shell is one started without non-option arguments (unless -s is specified) and without the -c option whose standard input and error are both connected to terminals  (as  deter‐\n       mined by isatty(3)), or one started with the -i option.  PS1 is set and $- includes i if bash is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to test this state.\n\n       The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files.  If any of the files exist but cannot be read, bash reports an error.  Tildes are expanded in filenames as described be‐\n       low under Tilde Expansion in the EXPANSION section.\n\n       When bash is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first reads and executes commands from the file /etc/profile, if  that  file  ex‐\n       ists.   After  reading  that  file, it looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile, in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable.\n       The --noprofile option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.\n\n       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell executes the exit builtin command, bash reads and executes commands from the file ~/.bash_logout, if it exists.\n\n       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell is started, bash reads and executes commands from /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist.  This may be inhibited by using the\n       --norc option.  The --rcfile file option will force bash to read and execute commands from file instead of /etc/bash.bashrc and ~/.bashrc.\n\n       When bash is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for example, it looks for the variable BASH_ENV in the environment, expands its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded\n       value as the name of a file to read and execute.  Bash behaves as if the following command were executed:\n              if [ -n \"$BASH_ENV\" ]; then . \"$BASH_ENV\"; fi\n       but the value of the PATH variable is not used to search for the filename.\n\n       If bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while conforming to the POSIX standard as well.  When  invoked\n       as  an  interactive login shell, or a non-interactive shell with the --login option, it first attempts to read and execute commands from /etc/profile and ~/.profile, in that order.  The --no‐\n       profile option may be used to inhibit this behavior.  When invoked as an interactive shell with the name sh, bash looks for the variable ENV, expands its value if it is defined, and uses  the\n       expanded  value  as the name of a file to read and execute.  Since a shell invoked as sh does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup files, the --rcfile option has no\n       effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the name sh does not attempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as sh, bash enters posix mode after the startup files are read.\n\n       When bash is started in posix mode, as with the --posix command line option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode, interactive shells expand  the  ENV  variable  and\n       commands are read and executed from the file whose name is the expanded value.  No other startup files are read.\n\n       Bash  attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as when executed by the remote shell daemon, usually rshd, or the secure shell dae‐\n       mon sshd.  If bash determines it is being run in this fashion, it reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc and ~/.bashrc, if these files exist and are readable.  It will not do this if  in‐\n       voked  as  sh.   The  --norc  option may be used to inhibit this behavior, and the --rcfile option may be used to force another file to be read, but neither rshd nor sshd generally invoke the\n       shell with those options or allow them to be specified.\n\n       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group) id, and the -p option is not supplied, no startup files are read, shell functions are not  inher‐\n       ited from the environment, the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CDPATH, and GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is set to the real user id.  If\n       the -p option is supplied at invocation, the startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n       The following definitions are used throughout the rest of this document.\n       blank  A space or tab.\n       word   A sequence of characters considered as a single unit by the shell.  Also known as a token.\n       name   A word consisting only of alphanumeric characters and underscores, and beginning with an alphabetic character or an underscore.  Also referred to as an identifier.\n       metacharacter\n              A character that, when unquoted, separates words.  One of the following:\n              |  & ; ( )  space tab newline\n       control operator\n              A token that performs a control function.  It is one of the following symbols:\n              || & && ; ;; ;& ;;& ( ) | |& \n\nRESERVED WORDS\n       Reserved words are words that have a special meaning to the shell.  The following words are recognized as reserved when unquoted and either the first word of a simple command (see SHELL GRAM‐\n       MAR below) or the third word of a case or for command:\n\n       ! case  coproc  do done elif else esac fi for function if in select then until while { } time [[ ]]\n\nSHELL GRAMMAR\n   Simple Commands\n       A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank-separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator.  The first word specifies the command\n       to be executed, and is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.\n\n       The return value of a simple command is its exit status, or 128+n if the command is terminated by signal n.\n\n   Pipelines\n       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of the control operators | or |&.  The format for a pipeline is:\n\n              [time [-p]] [ ! ] command [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]\n\n       The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.  This connection is performed before any redirections specified by the command (see  REDIRECTION  be‐\n       low).   If |& is used, command's standard error, in addition to its standard output, is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |.  This implicit re‐\n       direction of the standard error to the standard output is performed after any redirections specified by the command.\n\n       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command, unless the pipefail option is enabled.  If pipefail is enabled, the pipeline's return status is the value of  the  last\n       (rightmost)  command  to  exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands exit successfully.  If the reserved word !  precedes a pipeline, the exit status of that pipeline is the logical\n       negation of the exit status as described above.  The shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate before returning a value.\n\n       If the time reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as well as user and system time consumed by its execution are reported when the pipeline terminates.  The -p option changes the out‐\n       put format to that specified by POSIX.  When the shell is in posix mode, it does not recognize time as a reserved word if the next token begins with a `-'.  The TIMEFORMAT variable may be set\n       to a format string that specifies how the timing information should be displayed; see the description of TIMEFORMAT under Shell Variables below.\n\n       When the shell is in posix mode, time may be followed by a newline.  In this case, the shell displays the total user and system time consumed by the shell and its  children.   The  TIMEFORMAT\n       variable may be used to specify the format of the time information.\n\n       Each  command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a subshell).  See COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT for a description of a subshell environment.  If the lastpipe option is\n       enabled using the shopt builtin (see the description of shopt below), the last element of a pipeline may be run by the shell process.\n\n   Lists\n       A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the operators ;, &, &&, or ||, and optionally terminated by one of ;, &, or .\n\n       Of these list operators, && and || have equal precedence, followed by ; and &, which have equal precedence.\n\n       A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a list instead of a semicolon to delimit commands.\n\n       If a command is terminated by the control operator &, the shell executes the command in the background in a subshell.  The shell does not wait for the command to finish, and the return status\n       is  0.   These are referred to as asynchronous commands.  Commands separated by a ; are executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in turn.  The return status is the\n       exit status of the last command executed.\n\n       AND and OR lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by the && and || control operators, respectively.  AND and OR lists are executed with left associativity.  An  AND  list  has\n       the form\n\n              command1 && command2\n\n       command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns an exit status of zero (success).\n\n       An OR list has the form\n\n              command1 || command2\n\n       command2 is executed if, and only if, command1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The return status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of the last command executed in the list.\n\n   Compound Commands\n       A  compound  command  is one of the following.  In most cases a list in a command's description may be separated from the rest of the command by one or more newlines, and may be followed by a\n       newline in place of a semicolon.\n\n       (list) list is executed in a subshell environment (see COMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT below).  Variable assignments and builtin commands that affect the shell's environment do  not  remain  in\n              effect after the command completes.  The return status is the exit status of list.\n\n       { list; }\n              list is simply executed in the current shell environment.  list must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This is known as a group command.  The return status is the exit status\n              of list.  Note that unlike the metacharacters ( and ), { and } are reserved words and must occur where a reserved word is permitted to be recognized.  Since they do not  cause  a  word\n              break, they must be separated from list by whitespace or another shell metacharacter.\n\n       ((expression))\n              The  expression  is evaluated according to the rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  If the value of the expression is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the re‐\n              turn status is 1.  This is exactly equivalent to let \"expression\".\n\n       [[ expression ]]\n              Return a status of 0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression expression.  Expressions are composed of the primaries described  below  under  CONDITIONAL  EXPRES‐\n              SIONS.   Word  splitting  and  pathname expansion are not performed on the words between the [[ and ]]; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command\n              substitution, process substitution, and quote removal are performed.  Conditional operators such as -f must be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.\n\n              When used with [[, the  operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.\n\n       See the description of the test builtin command (section SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) for the handling of parameters (i.e.  missing parameters).\n\n       When the == and != operators are used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to the rules described below under Pattern  Matching,  as  if  the\n       extglob  shell  option  were enabled.  The = operator is equivalent to ==.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic charac‐\n       ters.  The return value is 0 if the string matches (==) or does not match (!=) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  Any part of the pattern may be quoted to force the quoted portion to  be  matched\n       as a string.\n\n       An  additional  binary  operator, =~, is available, with the same precedence as == and !=.  When it is used, the string to the right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular ex‐\n       pression and matched accordingly (as in regex(3)).  The return value is 0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the condi‐\n       tional expression's return value is 2.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  Any part of the pattern may be\n       quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as a string.  Bracket expressions in regular expressions must be treated carefully, since normal quoting characters lose  their  meanings  be‐\n       tween  brackets.  If the pattern is stored in a shell variable, quoting the variable expansion forces the entire pattern to be matched as a string.  Substrings matched by parenthesized subex‐\n       pressions within the regular expression are saved in the array variable BASH_REMATCH.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the  entire  regular  ex‐\n       pression.  The element of BASH_REMATCH with index n is the portion of the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.\n\n       Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence:\n\n              ( expression )\n                     Returns the value of expression.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.\n              ! expression\n                     True if expression is false.\n              expression1 && expression2\n                     True if both expression1 and expression2 are true.\n              expression1 || expression2\n                     True if either expression1 or expression2 is true.\n\n              The && and || operators do not evaluate expression2 if the value of expression1 is sufficient to determine the return value of the entire conditional expression.\n\n       for name [ [ in [ word ... ] ] ; ] do list ; done\n              The  list of words following in is expanded, generating a list of items.  The variable name is set to each element of this list in turn, and list is executed each time.  If the in word\n              is omitted, the for command executes list once for each positional parameter that is set (see PARAMETERS below).  The return status is the exit status of the  last  command  that  exe‐\n              cutes.  If the expansion of the items following in results in an empty list, no commands are executed, and the return status is 0.\n\n       for (( expr1 ; expr2 ; expr3 )) ; do list ; done\n              First,  the  arithmetic  expression expr1 is evaluated according to the rules described below under ARITHMETIC EVALUATION.  The arithmetic expression expr2 is then evaluated repeatedly\n              until it evaluates to zero.  Each time expr2 evaluates to a non-zero value, list is executed and the arithmetic expression expr3 is evaluated.  If any expression is omitted, it behaves\n              as if it evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last command in list that is executed, or false if any of the expressions is invalid.\n\n       select name [ in word ] ; do list ; done\n              The list of words following in is expanded, generating a list of items.  The set of expanded words is printed on the standard error, each preceded by a number.  If the in word is omit‐\n              ted, the positional parameters are printed (see PARAMETERS below).  The PS3 prompt is then displayed and a line read from the standard input.  If the line consists of a  number  corre‐\n              sponding  to  one of the displayed words, then the value of name is set to that word.  If the line is empty, the words and prompt are displayed again.  If EOF is read, the command com‐\n              pletes.  Any other value read causes name to be set to null.  The line read is saved in the variable REPLY.  The list is executed after each selection until a  break  command  is  exe‐\n              cuted.  The exit status of select is the exit status of the last command executed in list, or zero if no commands were executed.\n\n       case word in [ [(] pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;; ] ... esac\n              A  case  command  first  expands  word, and tries to match it against each pattern in turn, using the matching rules described under Pattern Matching below.  The word is expanded using\n              tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, process substitution and quote removal.  Each pattern examined is  expanded  using  tilde\n              expansion,  parameter  and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, command substitution, and process substitution.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is performed\n              without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  When a match is found, the corresponding list is executed.  If the ;; operator is used, no subsequent matches are attempted  after\n              the  first  pattern  match.   Using ;& in place of ;; causes execution to continue with the list associated with the next set of patterns.  Using ;;& in place of ;; causes the shell to\n              test the next pattern list in the statement, if any, and execute any associated list on a successful match.  The exit status is zero if no pattern matches.  Otherwise, it is  the  exit\n              status of the last command executed in list.\n\n       if list; then list; [ elif list; then list; ] ... [ else list; ] fi\n              The  if list is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the then list is executed.  Otherwise, each elif list is executed in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the corresponding then\n              list is executed and the command completes.  Otherwise, the else list is executed, if present.  The exit status is the exit status of the last command executed, or zero if no condition\n              tested true.\n\n       while list-1; do list-2; done\n       until list-1; do list-2; done\n              The while command continuously executes the list list-2 as long as the last command in the list list-1 returns an exit status of zero.  The until command is identical to the while com‐\n              mand, except that the test is negated: list-2 is executed as long as the last command in list-1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The exit status of the while and until commands is  the\n              exit status of the last command executed in list-2, or zero if none was executed.\n\n   Coprocesses\n       A  coprocess is a shell command preceded by the coproc reserved word.  A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command had been terminated with the & control operator,\n       with a two-way pipe established between the executing shell and the coprocess.\n\n       The format for a coprocess is:\n\n              coproc [NAME] command [redirections]\n\n       This creates a coprocess named NAME.  If NAME is not supplied, the default name is COPROC.  NAME must not be supplied if command is a simple command (see above); otherwise, it is  interpreted\n       as  the  first word of the simple command.  When the coprocess is executed, the shell creates an array variable (see Arrays below) named NAME in the context of the executing shell.  The stan‐\n       dard output of command is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to NAME[0].  The standard input of command is connected via  a\n       pipe  to a file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is assigned to NAME[1].  This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the command (see REDIRECTION\n       below).  The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands and redirections using standard word expansions.  Other than those created to execute command and process  substi‐\n       tutions,  the  file  descriptors  are  not  available in subshells.  The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is available as the value of the variable NAME_PID.  The wait\n       builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.\n\n       Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command, the coproc command always returns success.  The return status of a coprocess is the exit status of command.\n\n   Shell Function Definitions\n       A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command and executes a compound command with a new set of positional parameters.  Shell functions are declared as follows:\n\n       name () compound-command [redirection]\n       function name [()] compound-command [redirection]\n              This defines a function named name.  The reserved word function is optional.  If the function reserved word is supplied, the parentheses are optional.  The body of the function is  the\n              compound  command  compound-command  (see  Compound  Commands above).  That command is usually a list of commands between { and }, but may be any command listed under Compound Commands\n              above, with one exception: If the function reserved word is used, but the parentheses are not supplied, the braces are required.  compound-command is executed whenever name  is  speci‐\n              fied  as  the  name  of a simple command.  When in posix mode, name may not be the name of one of the POSIX special builtins.  Any redirections (see REDIRECTION below) specified when a\n              function is defined are performed when the function is executed.  The exit status of a function definition is zero unless a syntax error occurs or a readonly  function  with  the  same\n              name already exists.  When executed, the exit status of a function is the exit status of the last command executed in the body.  (See FUNCTIONS below.)\n\nCOMMENTS\n       In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the interactive_comments option to the shopt builtin is enabled (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), a word beginning with # causes\n       that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored.  An interactive shell without the interactive_comments option enabled does not allow comments.  The interactive_comments op‐\n       tion is on by default in interactive shells.\n\nQUOTING\n       Quoting  is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters, to prevent reserved words\n       from being recognized as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.\n\n       Each of the metacharacters listed above under DEFINITIONS has special meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.\n\n       When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see HISTORY EXPANSION below), the history expansion character, usually !, must be quoted to prevent history expansion.\n\n       There are three quoting mechanisms: the escape character, single quotes, and double quotes.\n\n       A non-quoted backslash (\\) is the escape character.  It preserves the literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of .  If a \\ pair appears, and the\n       backslash is not itself quoted, the \\ is treated as a line continuation (that is, it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).\n\n       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.\n\n       Enclosing  characters  in  double  quotes  preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $, `, \\, and, when history expansion is enabled, !.  When the\n       shell is in posix mode, the ! has no special meaning within double quotes, even when history expansion is enabled.  The characters $ and ` retain their special meaning within  double  quotes.\n       The  backslash  retains its special meaning only when followed by one of the following characters: $, `, \", \\, or .  A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it\n       with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be performed unless an !  appearing in double quotes is escaped using a backslash.  The backslash preceding the !  is not removed.\n\n       The special parameters * and @ have special meaning when in double quotes (see PARAMETERS below).\n\n       Words of the form $'string' are treated specially.  The word expands to string, with backslash-escaped characters replaced as specified by the ANSI C standard.  Backslash escape sequences, if\n       present, are decoded as follows:\n              \\a     alert (bell)\n              \\b     backspace\n              \\e\n              \\E     an escape character\n              \\f     form feed\n              \\n     new line\n              \\r     carriage return\n              \\t     horizontal tab\n              \\v     vertical tab\n              \\\\     backslash\n              \\'     single quote\n              \\\"     double quote\n              \\?     question mark\n              \\nnn   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three octal digits)\n              \\xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)\n              \\uHHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)\n              \\UHHHHHHHH\n                     the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)\n              \\cx    a control-x character\n\n       The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the dollar sign had not been present.\n\n       A  double-quoted  string preceded by a dollar sign ($\"string\") will cause the string to be translated according to the current locale.  If the current locale is C or POSIX, the dollar sign is\n       ignored.  If the string is translated and replaced, the replacement is double-quoted.\n\nPARAMETERS\n       A parameter is an entity that stores values.  It can be a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed below under Special Parameters.  A variable is a parameter denoted by a name.\n       A variable has a value and zero or more attributes.  Attributes are assigned using the declare builtin command (see declare below in SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS).\n\n       A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using the unset builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COM‐\n       MANDS below).\n\n       A variable may be assigned to by a statement of the form\n\n              name=[value]\n\n       If value is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All values undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion,  and  quote\n       removal  (see  EXPANSION below).  If the variable has its integer attribute set, then value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is not used (see Arithmetic\n       Expansion below).  Word splitting is not performed, with the exception of \"$@\" as explained below under Special Parameters.  Pathname expansion is not performed.   Assignment  statements  may\n       also appear as arguments to the alias, declare, typeset, export, readonly, and local builtin commands (declaration commands).  When in posix mode, these builtins may appear in a command after\n       one or more instances of the command builtin and retain these assignment statement properties.\n\n       In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous  value.   This\n       includes  arguments  to  builtin  commands such as declare that accept assignment statements (declaration commands).  When += is applied to a variable for which the integer attribute has been\n       set, value is evaluated as an arithmetic expression and added to the variable's current value, which is also evaluated.  When += is applied to an array variable using compound assignment (see\n       Arrays below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is when using =), and new values are appended to the array beginning at one greater than the array's maximum index (for indexed arrays)\n       or added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array.  When applied to a string-valued variable, value is expanded and appended to the variable's value.\n\n       A variable can be assigned the nameref attribute using the -n option to the declare or local builtin commands (see the descriptions of declare and local below) to create a nameref, or a  ref‐\n       erence  to  another variable.  This allows variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever the nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its attributes modified (other than\n       using or changing the nameref attribute itself), the operation is actually performed on the variable specified by the nameref variable's value.  A nameref is commonly used within shell  func‐\n       tions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argument to the function.  For instance, if a variable name is passed to a shell function as its first argument, running\n              declare -n ref=$1\n       inside  the  function  creates  a  nameref  variable  ref whose value is the variable name passed as the first argument.  References and assignments to ref, and changes to its attributes, are\n       treated as references, assignments, and attribute modifications to the variable whose name was passed as $1.  If the control variable in a for loop has the  nameref  attribute,  the  list  of\n       words  can  be  a list of shell variables, and a name reference will be established for each word in the list, in turn, when the loop is executed.  Array variables cannot be given the nameref\n       attribute.  However, nameref variables can reference array variables and subscripted array variables.  Namerefs can be unset using the -n option to the unset builtin.  Otherwise, if unset  is\n       executed with the name of a nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by the nameref variable will be unset.\n\n   Positional Parameters\n       A  positional parameter is a parameter denoted by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may\n       be reassigned using the set builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are temporarily replaced when a  shell  func‐\n       tion is executed (see FUNCTIONS below).\n\n       When a positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see EXPANSION below).\n\n   Special Parameters\n       The shell treats several parameters specially.  These parameters may only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.\n       *      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  When the expansion is not within double quotes, each positional parameter expands to a separate word.  In contexts where it is\n              performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and pathname expansion.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of each\n              parameter  separated  by  the first character of the IFS special variable.  That is, \"$*\" is equivalent to \"$1c$2c...\", where c is the first character of the value of the IFS variable.\n              If IFS is unset, the parameters are separated by spaces.  If IFS is null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.\n       @      Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one.  In contexts where word splitting is performed, this expands each positional parameter to a separate word; if not within double\n              quotes,  these  words  are  subject  to  word splitting.  In contexts where word splitting is not performed, this expands to a single word with each positional parameter separated by a\n              space.  When the expansion occurs within double quotes, each parameter expands to a separate word.  That is, \"$@\" is equivalent to \"$1\" \"$2\" ...  If the double-quoted expansion  occurs\n              within  a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with the last part of the\n              original word.  When there are no positional parameters, \"$@\" and $@ expand to nothing (i.e., they are removed).\n       #      Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.\n       ?      Expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.\n       -      Expands to the current option flags as specified upon invocation, by the set builtin command, or those set by the shell itself (such as the -i option).\n       $      Expands to the process ID of the shell.  In a () subshell, it expands to the process ID of the current shell, not the subshell.\n       !      Expands to the process ID of the job most recently placed into the background, whether executed as an asynchronous command or using the bg builtin (see JOB CONTROL below).\n       0      Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This is set at shell initialization.  If bash is invoked with a file of commands, $0 is set to the name of that  file.   If  bash  is\n              started with the -c option, then $0 is set to the first argument after the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it is set to the filename used to invoke bash, as given\n              by argument zero.\n       _      At shell startup, set to the absolute pathname used to invoke the shell or shell script being executed as passed in the environment or argument list.  Subsequently, expands to the last\n              argument  to  the previous simple command executed in the foreground, after expansion.  Also set to the full pathname used to invoke each command executed and placed in the environment\n              exported to that command.  When checking mail, this parameter holds the name of the mail file currently being checked.\n\n   Shell Variables\n       The following variables are set by the shell:\n\n       BASH   Expands to the full filename used to invoke this instance of bash.\n       BASHOPTS\n              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in the list is a valid argument for the -s option to the shopt builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The  op‐\n              tions appearing in BASHOPTS are those reported as on by shopt.  If this variable is in the environment when bash starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before reading\n              any startup files.  This variable is read-only.\n       BASHPID\n              Expands to the process ID of the current bash process.  This differs from $$ under certain circumstances, such as subshells that do not require bash to be re-initialized.   Assignments\n              to BASHPID have no effect.  If BASHPID is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       BASH_ALIASES\n              An  associative array variable whose members correspond to the internal list of aliases as maintained by the alias builtin.  Elements added to this array appear in the alias list; how‐\n              ever, unsetting array elements currently does not cause aliases to be removed from the alias list.  If BASH_ALIASES is unset, it loses its special properties,  even  if  it  is  subse‐\n              quently reset.\n       BASH_ARGC\n              An  array variable whose values are the number of parameters in each frame of the current bash execution call stack.  The number of parameters to the current subroutine (shell function\n              or script executed with . or source) is at the top of the stack.  When a subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed is pushed onto BASH_ARGC.   The  shell  sets  BASH_ARGC\n              only when in extended debugging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).  Setting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a script, or ref‐\n              erencing this variable when extdebug is not set, may result in inconsistent values.\n       BASH_ARGV\n              An array variable containing all of the parameters in the current bash execution call stack.  The final parameter of the last subroutine call is at the top of the stack; the first  pa‐\n              rameter  of the initial call is at the bottom.  When a subroutine is executed, the parameters supplied are pushed onto BASH_ARGV.  The shell sets BASH_ARGV only when in extended debug‐\n              ging mode (see the description of the extdebug option to the shopt builtin below).  Setting extdebug after the shell has started to execute a script, or referencing this variable  when\n              extdebug is not set, may result in inconsistent values.\n       BASH_ARGV0\n              When  referenced,  this  variable expands to the name of the shell or shell script (identical to $0; see the description of special parameter 0 above).  Assignment to BASH_ARGV0 causes\n              the value assigned to also be assigned to $0.  If BASH_ARGV0 is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       BASH_CMDS\n              An associative array variable whose members correspond to the internal hash table of commands as maintained by the hash builtin.  Elements added to this array appear in the hash table;\n              however,  unsetting array elements currently does not cause command names to be removed from the hash table.  If BASH_CMDS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is sub‐\n              sequently reset.\n       BASH_COMMAND\n              The command currently being executed or about to be executed, unless the shell is executing a command as the result of a trap, in which case it is the command executing at the time  of\n              the trap.\n       BASH_EXECUTION_STRING\n              The command argument to the -c invocation option.\n       BASH_LINENO\n              An  array variable whose members are the line numbers in source files where each corresponding member of FUNCNAME was invoked.  ${BASH_LINENO[$i]} is the line number in the source file\n              (${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}) where ${FUNCNAME[$i]} was called (or ${BASH_LINENO[$i-1]} if referenced within another shell function).  Use LINENO to obtain the current line number.\n       BASH_LOADABLES_PATH\n              A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for dynamically loadable builtins specified by the enable command.\n       BASH_REMATCH\n              An array variable whose members are assigned by the =~ binary operator to the [[ conditional command.  The element with index 0 is the portion of the string matching the entire regular\n              expression.  The element with index n is the portion of the string matching the nth parenthesized subexpression.  This variable is read-only.\n       BASH_SOURCE\n              An array variable whose members are the source filenames where the corresponding shell function names in the FUNCNAME array variable are defined.  The shell function ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is\n              defined in the file ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and called from ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.\n       BASH_SUBSHELL\n              Incremented by one within each subshell or subshell environment when the shell begins executing in that environment.  The initial value is 0.\n       BASH_VERSINFO\n              A readonly array variable whose members hold version information for this instance of bash.  The values assigned to the array members are as follows:\n              BASH_VERSINFO[0]        The major version number (the release).\n              BASH_VERSINFO[1]        The minor version number (the version).\n              BASH_VERSINFO[2]        The patch level.\n              BASH_VERSINFO[3]        The build version.\n              BASH_VERSINFO[4]        The release status (e.g., beta1).\n              BASH_VERSINFO[5]        The value of MACHTYPE.\n       BASH_VERSION\n              Expands to a string describing the version of this instance of bash.\n       COMP_CWORD\n              An index into ${COMP_WORDS} of the word containing the current cursor position.  This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the  programmable  completion  facilities\n              (see Programmable Completion below).\n       COMP_KEY\n              The key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the current completion function.\n       COMP_LINE\n              The  current  command line.  This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion be‐\n              low).\n       COMP_POINT\n              The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of the current command.  If the current cursor position is at the end of the current command, the value of this vari‐\n              able is equal to ${#COMP_LINE}.  This variable is available only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion\n              below).\n       COMP_TYPE\n              Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of completion attempted that caused a completion function to be called: TAB, for normal completion, ?, for listing  completions  after\n              successive  tabs,  !,  for listing alternatives on partial word completion, @, to list completions if the word is not unmodified, or %, for menu completion.  This variable is available\n              only in shell functions and external commands invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).\n       COMP_WORDBREAKS\n              The set of characters that the readline library treats as word separators when performing word completion.  If COMP_WORDBREAKS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it  is\n              subsequently reset.\n       COMP_WORDS\n              An  array variable (see Arrays below) consisting of the individual words in the current command line.  The line is split into words as readline would split it, using COMP_WORDBREAKS as\n              described above.  This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion below).\n       COPROC An array variable (see Arrays below) created to hold the file descriptors for output from and input to an unnamed coprocess (see Coprocesses above).\n       DIRSTACK\n              An array variable (see Arrays below) containing the current contents of the directory stack.  Directories appear in the stack in the order they are displayed by the dirs builtin.   As‐\n              signing  to  members of this array variable may be used to modify directories already in the stack, but the pushd and popd builtins must be used to add and remove directories.  Assign‐\n              ment to this variable will not change the current directory.  If DIRSTACK is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       EPOCHREALTIME\n              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see time(3)) as a floating point value with micro-second granularity.  Assignments  to\n              EPOCHREALTIME are ignored.  If EPOCHREALTIME is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       EPOCHSECONDS\n              Each  time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see time(3)).  Assignments to EPOCHSECONDS are ignored.  If EPOCHSECONDS is unset, it\n              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       EUID   Expands to the effective user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.\n       FUNCNAME\n              An array variable containing the names of all shell functions currently in the execution call stack.  The element with index 0 is the name of any  currently-executing  shell  function.\n              The bottom-most element (the one with the highest index) is \"main\".  This variable exists only when a shell function is executing.  Assignments to FUNCNAME have no effect.  If FUNCNAME\n              is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n\n              This variable can be used with BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE.  Each element of FUNCNAME has corresponding elements in BASH_LINENO and BASH_SOURCE to describe the  call  stack.   For  in‐\n              stance, ${FUNCNAME[$i]} was called from the file ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]} at line number ${BASH_LINENO[$i]}.  The caller builtin displays the current call stack using this information.\n       GROUPS An array variable containing the list of groups of which the current user is a member.  Assignments to GROUPS have no effect.  If GROUPS is unset, it loses its special properties, even\n              if it is subsequently reset.\n       HISTCMD\n              The history number, or index in the history list, of the current command.  If HISTCMD is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       HOSTNAME\n              Automatically set to the name of the current host.\n       HOSTTYPE\n              Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes the type of machine on which bash is executing.  The default is system-dependent.\n       LINENO Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes a decimal number representing the current sequential line number (starting with 1) within a script or function.  When  not\n              in a script or function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to be meaningful.  If LINENO is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       MACHTYPE\n              Automatically set to a string that fully describes the system type on which bash is executing, in the standard GNU cpu-company-system format.  The default is system-dependent.\n       MAPFILE\n              An array variable (see Arrays below) created to hold the text read by the mapfile builtin when no variable name is supplied.\n       OLDPWD The previous working directory as set by the cd command.\n       OPTARG The value of the last option argument processed by the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n       OPTIND The index of the next argument to be processed by the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n       OSTYPE Automatically set to a string that describes the operating system on which bash is executing.  The default is system-dependent.\n       PIPESTATUS\n              An  array variable (see Arrays below) containing a list of exit status values from the processes in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may contain only a single com‐\n              mand).\n       PPID   The process ID of the shell's parent.  This variable is readonly.\n       PWD    The current working directory as set by the cd command.\n       RANDOM Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer between 0 and 32767 is generated.  The sequence of random numbers may be initialized by assigning a value to RANDOM.  If RANDOM\n              is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       READLINE_LINE\n              The contents of the readline line buffer, for use with \"bind -x\" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n       READLINE_POINT\n              The position of the insertion point in the readline line buffer, for use with \"bind -x\" (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n       REPLY  Set to the line of input read by the read builtin command when no arguments are supplied.\n       SECONDS\n              Each  time  this parameter is referenced, the number of seconds since shell invocation is returned.  If a value is assigned to SECONDS, the value returned upon subsequent references is\n              the number of seconds since the assignment plus the value assigned.  If SECONDS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.\n       SHELLOPTS\n              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in the list is a valid argument for the -o option to the set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS  below).   The  op‐\n              tions appearing in SHELLOPTS are those reported as on by set -o.  If this variable is in the environment when bash starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before read‐\n              ing any startup files.  This variable is read-only.\n       SHLVL  Incremented by one each time an instance of bash is started.\n       UID    Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.\n\n       The following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases, bash assigns a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.\n\n       BASH_COMPAT\n              The value is used to set the shell's compatibility level.  See the description of the shopt builtin below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS for a description of  the  various  compatibility\n              levels  and  their effects.  The value may be a decimal number (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding to the desired compatibility level.  If BASH_COMPAT is unset or set to\n              the empty string, the compatibility level is set to the default for the current version.  If BASH_COMPAT is set to a value that is not one of the valid compatibility levels, the  shell\n              prints an error message and sets the compatibility level to the default for the current version.  The valid compatibility levels correspond to the compatibility options accepted by the\n              shopt builtin described below (for example, compat42 means that 4.2 and 42 are valid values).  The current version is also a valid value.\n       BASH_ENV\n              If this parameter is set when bash is executing a shell script, its value is interpreted as a filename containing commands to initialize the shell,  as  in  ~/.bashrc.   The  value  of\n              BASH_ENV is subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being interpreted as a filename.  PATH is not used to search for the resultant file‐\n              name.\n       BASH_XTRACEFD\n              If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor, bash will write the trace output generated when set -x is enabled to that file descriptor.  The file descriptor is closed\n              when BASH_XTRACEFD is unset or assigned a new value.  Unsetting BASH_XTRACEFD or assigning it the empty string causes the trace output to be sent to the standard error.  Note that set‐\n              ting BASH_XTRACEFD to 2 (the standard error file descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed.\n       CDPATH The search path for the cd command.  This is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for destination directories specified by the cd command.  A sample value  is\n              \".:~:/usr\".\n       CHILD_MAX\n              Set  the  number  of  exited child status values for the shell to remember.  Bash will not allow this value to be decreased below a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is a maximum value\n              (currently 8192) that this may not exceed.  The minimum value is system-dependent.\n       COLUMNS\n              Used by the select compound command to determine the terminal width when printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the checkwinsize option is enabled or in an  interactive  shell\n              upon receipt of a SIGWINCH.\n       COMPREPLY\n              An  array  variable  from  which  bash reads the possible completions generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion facility (see Programmable Completion below).\n              Each array element contains one possible completion.\n       EMACS  If bash finds this variable in the environment when the shell starts with value \"t\", it assumes that the shell is running in an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.\n       ENV    Similar to BASH_ENV; used when the shell is invoked in posix mode.\n       EXECIGNORE\n              A colon-separated list of shell patterns (see Pattern Matching) defining the list of filenames to be ignored by command search using PATH.  Files whose  full  pathnames  match  one  of\n              these  patterns are not considered executable files for the purposes of completion and command execution via PATH lookup.  This does not affect the behavior of the [, test, and [[ com‐\n              mands.  Full pathnames in the command hash table are not subject to EXECIGNORE.  Use this variable to ignore shared library files that have the executable bit set,  but  are  not  exe‐\n              cutable files.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.\n       FCEDIT The default editor for the fc builtin command.\n       FIGNORE\n              A  colon-separated  list of suffixes to ignore when performing filename completion (see READLINE below).  A filename whose suffix matches one of the entries in FIGNORE is excluded from\n              the list of matched filenames.  A sample value is \".o:~\" (Quoting is needed when assigning a value to this variable, which contains tildes).\n       FUNCNEST\n              If set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed this nesting level will cause the current command to abort.\n       GLOBIGNORE\n              A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of file names to be ignored by pathname expansion.  If a file name matched by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one  of  the\n              patterns in GLOBIGNORE, it is removed from the list of matches.\n       HISTCONTROL\n              A  colon-separated  list of values controlling how commands are saved on the history list.  If the list of values includes ignorespace, lines which begin with a space character are not\n              saved in the history list.  A value of ignoredups causes lines matching the previous history entry to not be saved.  A value of ignoreboth is shorthand for ignorespace and  ignoredups.\n              A value of erasedups causes all previous lines matching the current line to be removed from the history list before that line is saved.  Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If\n              HISTCONTROL is unset, or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value of HISTIGNORE.  The  second  and  subse‐\n              quent lines of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of HISTCONTROL.\n       HISTFILE\n              The name of the file in which command history is saved (see HISTORY below).  The default value is ~/.bash_history.  If unset, the command history is not saved when a shell exits.\n       HISTFILESIZE\n              The  maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than that number of\n              lines by removing the oldest entries.  The history file is also truncated to this size after writing it when a shell exits.  If the value is 0, the history file is  truncated  to  zero\n              size.  Non-numeric values and numeric values less than zero inhibit truncation.  The shell sets the default value to the value of HISTSIZE after reading any startup files.\n       HISTIGNORE\n              A  colon-separated  list  of  patterns used to decide which command lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the\n              complete line (no implicit `*' is appended).  Each pattern is tested against the line after the checks specified by HISTCONTROL are applied.  In addition to the  normal  shell  pattern\n              matching  characters, `&' matches the previous history line.  `&' may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.  The second and subsequent lines\n              of a multi-line compound command are not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of HISTIGNORE.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the extglob  shell  op‐\n              tion.\n       HISTSIZE\n              The  number of commands to remember in the command history (see HISTORY below).  If the value is 0, commands are not saved in the history list.  Numeric values less than zero result in\n              every command being saved on the history list (there is no limit).  The shell sets the default value to 500 after reading any startup files.\n       HISTTIMEFORMAT\n              If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string for strftime(3) to print the time stamp associated with each history entry displayed by the history  builtin.\n              If  this variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file so they may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps\n              from other history lines.\n       HOME   The home directory of the current user; the default argument for the cd builtin command.  The value of this variable is also used when performing tilde expansion.\n       HOSTFILE\n              Contains the name of a file in the same format as /etc/hosts that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname.  The list of possible hostname completions may be  changed\n              while the shell is running; the next time hostname completion is attempted after the value is changed, bash adds the contents of the new file to the existing list.  If HOSTFILE is set,\n              but has no value, or does not name a readable file, bash attempts to read /etc/hosts to obtain the list of possible hostname completions.  When HOSTFILE is unset, the hostname list  is\n              cleared.\n       IFS    The  Internal  Field  Separator  that  is used for word splitting after expansion and to split lines into words with the read builtin command.  The default value is ``''.\n       IGNOREEOF\n              Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an EOF character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of consecutive EOF characters which must be typed as  the\n              first  characters  on  an  input line before bash exits.  If the variable exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no value, the default value is 10.  If it does not exist, EOF\n              signifies the end of input to the shell.\n       INPUTRC\n              The filename for the readline startup file, overriding the default of ~/.inputrc (see READLINE below).\n       INSIDE_EMACS\n              If this variable appears in the environment when the shell starts, bash assumes that it is running inside an Emacs shell buffer and may disable line editing, depending on the value  of\n              TERM.\n       LANG   Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically selected with a variable starting with LC_.\n       LC_ALL This variable overrides the value of LANG and any other LC_ variable specifying a locale category.\n       LC_COLLATE\n              This  variable  determines the collation order used when sorting the results of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes, and collating\n              sequences within pathname expansion and pattern matching.\n       LC_CTYPE\n              This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the behavior of character classes within pathname expansion and pattern matching.\n       LC_MESSAGES\n              This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted strings preceded by a $.\n       LC_NUMERIC\n              This variable determines the locale category used for number formatting.\n       LC_TIME\n              This variable determines the locale category used for data and time formatting.\n       LINES  Used by the select compound command to determine the column length for printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the checkwinsize option is enabled or  in  an  interactive  shell\n              upon receipt of a SIGWINCH.\n       MAIL   If  this  parameter is set to a file or directory name and the MAILPATH variable is not set, bash informs the user of the arrival of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format direc‐\n              tory.\n       MAILCHECK\n              Specifies how often (in seconds) bash checks for mail.  The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt.  If  this\n              variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.\n       MAILPATH\n              A  colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail.  The message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file may be specified by separating the filename from the mes‐\n              sage with a `?'.  When used in the text of the message, $_ expands to the name of the current mailfile.  Example:\n              MAILPATH='/var/mail/bfox?\"You have mail\":~/shell-mail?\"$_ has mail!\"'\n              Bash can be configured to supply a default value for this variable (there is no value by default), but the location of the user mail files that  it  uses  is  system  dependent  (e.g.,\n              /var/mail/$USER).\n       OPTERR If  set to the value 1, bash displays error messages generated by the getopts builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  OPTERR is initialized to 1 each time the shell is in‐\n              voked or a shell script is executed.\n       PATH   The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands (see COMMAND EXECUTION below).  A zero-length (null) directory name  in\n              the  value of PATH indicates the current directory.  A null directory name may appear as two adjacent colons, or as an initial or trailing colon.  The default path is system-dependent,\n              and is set by the administrator who installs bash.  A common value is ``/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin''.\n       POSIXLY_CORRECT\n              If this variable is in the environment when bash starts, the shell enters posix mode before reading the startup files, as if the --posix invocation option had been supplied.  If it  is\n              set  while  the  shell is running, bash enables posix mode, as if the command set -o posix had been executed.  When the shell enters posix mode, it sets this variable if it was not al‐\n              ready set.\n       PROMPT_COMMAND\n              If set, the value is executed as a command prior to issuing each primary prompt.\n       PROMPT_DIRTRIM\n              If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the number of trailing directory components to retain when expanding the \\w and \\W prompt string escapes (see  PROMPTING  be‐\n              low).  Characters removed are replaced with an ellipsis.\n       PS0    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and displayed by interactive shells after reading a command and before the command is executed.\n       PS1    The value of this parameter is expanded (see PROMPTING below) and used as the primary prompt string.  The default value is ``\\s-\\v\\$ ''.\n       PS2    The value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and used as the secondary prompt string.  The default is ``> ''.\n       PS3    The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the select command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).\n       PS4    The  value of this parameter is expanded as with PS1 and the value is printed before each command bash displays during an execution trace.  The first character of the expanded value of\n              PS4 is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection.  The default is ``+ ''.\n       SHELL  The full pathname to the shell is kept in this environment variable.  If it is not set when the shell starts, bash assigns to it the full pathname of the current user's login shell.\n       TIMEFORMAT\n              The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the time reserved word should be displayed.   The  %  character\n              introduces an escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or other information.  The escape sequences and their meanings are as follows; the braces denote optional portions.\n              %%        A literal %.\n              %[p][l]R  The elapsed time in seconds.\n              %[p][l]U  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.\n              %[p][l]S  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.\n              %P        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.\n\n              The  optional  p  is  a  digit specifying the precision, the number of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output.  At most\n              three places after the decimal point may be specified; values of p greater than 3 are changed to 3.  If p is not specified, the value 3 is used.\n\n              The optional l specifies a longer format, including minutes, of the form MMmSS.FFs.  The value of p determines whether or not the fraction is included.\n\n              If this variable is not set, bash acts as if it had the value $'\\nreal\\t%3lR\\nuser\\t%3lU\\nsys\\t%3lS'.  If the value is null, no timing information is displayed.  A trailing newline  is\n              added when the format string is displayed.\n       TMOUT  If  set to a value greater than zero, TMOUT is treated as the default timeout for the read builtin.  The select command terminates if input does not arrive after TMOUT seconds when in‐\n              put is coming from a terminal.  In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input after issuing the primary  prompt.   Bash  termi‐\n              nates after waiting for that number of seconds if a complete line of input does not arrive.\n       TMPDIR If set, bash uses its value as the name of a directory in which bash creates temporary files for the shell's use.\n       auto_resume\n              This  variable  controls how the shell interacts with the user and job control.  If this variable is set, single word simple commands without redirections are treated as candidates for\n              resumption of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed; if there is more than one job beginning with the string typed, the job most recently accessed is  selected.   The\n              name  of  a  stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to start it.  If set to the value exact, the string supplied must match the name of a stopped job exactly; if set to\n              substring, the string supplied needs to match a substring of the name of a stopped job.  The substring value provides functionality analogous to the %?  job identifier (see JOB CONTROL\n              below).  If set to any other value, the supplied string must be a prefix of a stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the %string job identifier.\n       histchars\n              The two or three characters which control history expansion and tokenization (see HISTORY EXPANSION below).  The first character is the history expansion character, the character which\n              signals the start of a history expansion, normally `!'.  The second character is the quick substitution character, which is used as shorthand for re-running the  previous  command  en‐\n              tered,  substituting one string for another in the command.  The default is `^'.  The optional third character is the character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a com‐\n              ment when found as the first character of a word, normally `#'.  The history comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the remaining words on the line.   It  does\n              not necessarily cause the shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.\n\n   Arrays\n       Bash  provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array variables.  Any variable may be used as an indexed array; the declare builtin will explicitly declare an array.  There is no maxi‐\n       mum limit on the size of an array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned contiguously.  Indexed arrays are referenced using integers (including arithmetic  expressions)  and\n       are zero-based; associative arrays are referenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless otherwise noted, indexed array indices must be non-negative integers.\n\n       An  indexed array is created automatically if any variable is assigned to using the syntax name[subscript]=value.  The subscript is treated as an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a\n       number.  To explicitly declare an indexed array, use declare -a name (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  declare -a name[subscript] is also accepted; the subscript is ignored.\n\n       Associative arrays are created using declare -A name.\n\n       Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the declare and readonly builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.\n\n       Arrays are assigned to using compound assignments of the form name=(value1 ... valuen), where each value is of the form [subscript]=string.  Indexed array assignments do not require  anything\n       but  string.   When  assigning to indexed arrays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied, that index is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last index\n       assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.\n\n       When assigning to an associative array, the subscript is required.\n\n       This syntax is also accepted by the declare builtin.  Individual array elements may be assigned to using the name[subscript]=value syntax introduced above.  When assigning to an  indexed  ar‐\n       ray,  if name is subscripted by a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of name, so negative indices count back from the end of the ar‐\n       ray, and an index of -1 references the last element.\n\n       Any element of an array may be referenced using ${name[subscript]}.  The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If subscript is @ or *, the word expands to all  mem‐\n       bers  of name.  These subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.  If the word is double-quoted, ${name[*]} expands to a single word with the value of each array member\n       separated by the first character of the IFS special variable, and ${name[@]} expands each element of name to a separate word.  When there are no array members, ${name[@]} expands to  nothing.\n       If  the  double-quoted  expansion occurs within a word, the expansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the original word, and the expansion of the last parameter is\n       joined with the last part of the original word.  This is analogous to the expansion of the special parameters * and @ (see Special  Parameters  above).   ${#name[subscript]}  expands  to  the\n       length  of ${name[subscript]}.  If subscript is * or @, the expansion is the number of elements in the array.  If the subscript used to reference an element of an indexed array evaluates to a\n       number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of the array, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index  of  -1  refer‐\n       ences the last element.\n\n       Referencing  an  array  variable without a subscript is equivalent to referencing the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a variable using a valid subscript is legal, and bash will\n       create an array if necessary.\n\n       An array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a value.  The null string is a valid value.\n\n       It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as the values.  ${!name[@]} and ${!name[*]} expand to the indices assigned in array variable name.  The treatment when in  dou‐\n       ble quotes is similar to the expansion of the special parameters @ and * within double quotes.\n\n       The unset builtin is used to destroy arrays.  unset name[subscript] destroys the array element at index subscript, for both indexed and associative arrays.  Negative subscripts to indexed ar‐\n       rays are interpreted as described above.  Unsetting the last element of an array variable does not unset the variable.  unset name, where name is an array,  or  unset  name[subscript],  where\n       subscript is * or @, removes the entire array.\n\n       When  using  a variable name with a subscript as an argument to a command, such as with unset, without using the word expansion syntax described above, the argument is subject to pathname ex‐\n       pansion.  If pathname expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted.\n\n       The declare, local, and readonly builtins each accept a -a option to specify an indexed array and a -A option to specify an associative array.  If both options are supplied, -A  takes  prece‐\n       dence.   The  read builtin accepts a -a option to assign a list of words read from the standard input to an array.  The set and declare builtins display array values in a way that allows them\n       to be reused as assignments.\n\nEXPANSION\n       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into words.  There are seven kinds of expansion performed: brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expan‐\n       sion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion.\n\n       The  order  of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word split‐\n       ting; and pathname expansion.\n\n       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion available: process substitution.  This is performed at the same time as tilde, parameter, variable, and  arithmetic  expansion\n       and command substitution.\n\n       After these expansions are performed, quote characters present in the original word are removed unless they have been quoted themselves (quote removal).\n\n       Only brace expansion, word splitting, and pathname expansion can increase the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand a single word to a single word.  The only exceptions to\n       this are the expansions of \"$@\" and \"${name[@]}\", and, in most cases, $* and ${name[*]} as explained above (see PARAMETERS).\n\n   Brace Expansion\n       Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated.  This mechanism is similar to pathname expansion, but the filenames generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace\n       expanded  take  the form of an optional preamble, followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, followed by an optional postscript.\n       The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left to right.\n\n       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order is preserved.  For example, a{d,c,b}e expands into `ade ace abe'.\n\n       A sequence expression takes the form {x..y[..incr]}, where x and y are either integers or single characters, and incr, an optional increment, is an integer.  When integers are  supplied,  the\n       expression  expands to each number between x and y, inclusive.  Supplied integers may be prefixed with 0 to force each term to have the same width.  When either x or y begins with a zero, the\n       shell attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.  When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexico‐\n       graphically  between  x  and  y, inclusive, using the default C locale.  Note that both x and y must be of the same type.  When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between\n       each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.\n\n       Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It is strictly textual.  Bash does not apply any syntac‐\n       tic interpretation to the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.\n\n       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence expression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is\n       left unchanged.  A { or , may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string ${ is not consid‐\n       ered eligible for brace expansion, and inhibits brace expansion until the closing }.\n\n       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:\n\n              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}\n       or\n              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}\n\n       Brace  expansion  introduces  a slight incompatibility with historical versions of sh.  sh does not treat opening or closing braces specially when they appear as part of a word, and preserves\n       them in the output.  Bash removes braces from words as a consequence of brace expansion.  For example, a word entered to sh as file{1,2} appears identically in the output.  The same  word  is\n       output as file1 file2 after expansion by bash.  If strict compatibility with sh is desired, start bash with the +B option or disable brace expansion with the +B option to the set command (see\n       SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\n   Tilde Expansion\n       If a word begins with an unquoted tilde character (`~'), all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or all characters, if there is no unquoted slash) are  considered  a  tilde-\n       prefix.  If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name.  If this login name is the null\n       string, the tilde is replaced with the value of the shell parameter HOME.  If HOME is unset, the home directory of the user executing the shell is substituted instead.  Otherwise, the  tilde-\n       prefix is replaced with the home directory associated with the specified login name.\n\n       If  the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable PWD replaces the tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of the shell variable OLDPWD, if it is set, is substi‐\n       tuted.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number N, optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-', the tilde-prefix is replaced  with  the  corresponding  element\n       from  the  directory  stack, as it would be displayed by the dirs builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argument.  If the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a\n       number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed.\n\n       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is unchanged.\n\n       Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immediately following a : or the first =.  In these cases, tilde expansion is also performed.  Consequently, one may use  file‐\n       names with tildes in assignments to PATH, MAILPATH, and CDPATH, and the shell assigns the expanded value.\n\n       Bash  also  performs  tilde  expansion on words satisfying the conditions of variable assignments (as described above under PARAMETERS) when they appear as arguments to simple commands.  Bash\n       does not do this, except for the declaration commands listed above, when in posix mode.\n\n   Parameter Expansion\n       The `$' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but\n       serve to protect the variable to be expanded from characters immediately following it which could be interpreted as part of the name.\n\n       When  braces  are used, the matching ending brace is the first `}' not escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an embedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution,\n       or parameter expansion.\n\n       ${parameter}\n              The value of parameter is substituted.  The braces are required when parameter is a positional parameter with more than one digit, or when parameter is followed by a character which is\n              not to be interpreted as part of its name.  The parameter is a shell parameter as described above PARAMETERS) or an array reference (Arrays).\n\n       If the first character of parameter is an exclamation point (!), and parameter is not a nameref, it introduces a level of indirection.  Bash uses the value formed by expanding the rest of pa‐\n       rameter as the new parameter; this is then expanded and that value is used in the rest of the expansion, rather than the expansion of the original parameter.  This is known as indirect expan‐\n       sion.  The value is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.  If parameter is a nameref, this expands to the name of the parameter ref‐\n       erenced by parameter instead of performing the complete indirect expansion.  The exceptions to this are the expansions of ${!prefix*} and ${!name[@]} described below.  The  exclamation  point\n       must immediately follow the left brace in order to introduce indirection.\n\n       In each of the cases below, word is subject to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.\n\n       When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented below (e.g., :-), bash tests for a parameter that is unset or null.  Omitting the colon results in a test only for a param‐\n       eter that is unset.\n\n       ${parameter:-word}\n              Use Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is substituted.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.\n       ${parameter:=word}\n              Assign Default Values.  If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word is assigned to parameter.  The value of parameter is then substituted.  Positional parameters  and  special\n              parameters may not be assigned to in this way.\n       ${parameter:?word}\n              Display  Error  if  Null  or  Unset.  If parameter is null or unset, the expansion of word (or a message to that effect if word is not present) is written to the standard error and the\n              shell, if it is not interactive, exits.  Otherwise, the value of parameter is substituted.\n       ${parameter:+word}\n              Use Alternate Value.  If parameter is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise the expansion of word is substituted.\n       ${parameter:offset}\n       ${parameter:offset:length}\n              Substring Expansion.  Expands to up to length characters of the value of parameter starting at the character specified by offset.  If parameter is @, an indexed array subscripted by  @\n              or *, or an associative array name, the results differ as described below.  If length is omitted, expands to the substring of the value of parameter starting at the character specified\n              by offset and extending to the end of the value.  length and offset are arithmetic expressions (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION below).\n\n              If offset evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter.  If length evaluates to a number less than zero, it\n              is interpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value of parameter rather than a number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between offset and that result.\n              Note that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at least one space to avoid being confused with the :- expansion.\n\n              If parameter is @, the result is length positional parameters beginning at offset.  A negative offset is taken relative to one greater than the greatest  positional  parameter,  so  an\n              offset of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter.  It is an expansion error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.\n\n              If  parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the result is the length members of the array beginning with ${parameter[offset]}.  A negative offset is taken relative to\n              one greater than the maximum index of the specified array.  It is an expansion error if length evaluates to a number less than zero.\n\n              Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces undefined results.\n\n              Substring indexing is zero-based unless the positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing starts at 1 by default.  If offset is 0, and the positional parameters are  used,\n              $0 is prefixed to the list.\n\n       ${!prefix*}\n       ${!prefix@}\n              Names matching prefix.  Expands to the names of variables whose names begin with prefix, separated by the first character of the IFS special variable.  When @ is used and the expansion\n              appears within double quotes, each variable name expands to a separate word.\n\n       ${!name[@]}\n       ${!name[*]}\n              List of array keys.  If name is an array variable, expands to the list of array indices (keys) assigned in name.  If name is not an array, expands to 0 if name is set and  null  other‐\n              wise.  When @ is used and the expansion appears within double quotes, each key expands to a separate word.\n\n       ${#parameter}\n              Parameter length.  The length in characters of the value of parameter is substituted.  If parameter is * or @, the value substituted is the number of positional parameters.  If parame‐\n              ter is an array name subscripted by * or @, the value substituted is the number of elements in the array.  If parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by a negative number,  that\n              number  is  interpreted as relative to one greater than the maximum index of parameter, so negative indices count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the last\n              element.\n\n       ${parameter#word}\n       ${parameter##word}\n              Remove matching prefix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the expanded value of parameter using the rules  described\n              under  Pattern  Matching  below.   If the pattern matches the beginning of the value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with the shortest\n              matching pattern (the ``#'' case) or the longest matching pattern (the ``##'' case) deleted.  If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each positional param‐\n              eter  in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member of the array\n              in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.\n\n       ${parameter%word}\n       ${parameter%%word}\n              Remove matching suffix pattern.  The word is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, and matched against the expanded value of parameter using the rules  described\n              under  Pattern  Matching  below.  If the pattern matches a trailing portion of the expanded value of parameter, then the result of the expansion is the expanded value of parameter with\n              the shortest matching pattern (the ``%'' case) or the longest matching pattern (the ``%%'' case) deleted.  If parameter is @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each  po‐\n              sitional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the pattern removal operation is applied to each member\n              of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.\n\n       ${parameter/pattern/string}\n              Pattern substitution.  The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion, Parameter is expanded and the longest match of pattern against its value is  replaced\n              with  string.  The match is performed using the rules described under Pattern Matching below.  If pattern begins with /, all matches of pattern are replaced with string.  Normally only\n              the first match is replaced.  If pattern begins with #, it must match at the beginning of the expanded value of parameter.  If pattern begins with %, it must match at the  end  of  the\n              expanded  value  of  parameter.  If string is null, matches of pattern are deleted and the / following pattern may be omitted.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the match is\n              performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  If parameter is @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is\n              the  resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or *, the substitution operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the re‐\n              sultant list.\n\n       ${parameter^pattern}\n       ${parameter^^pattern}\n       ${parameter,pattern}\n       ${parameter,,pattern}\n              Case modification.  This expansion modifies the case of alphabetic characters in parameter.  The pattern is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion.  Each character\n              in  the  expanded value of parameter is tested against pattern, and, if it matches the pattern, its case is converted.  The pattern should not attempt to match more than one character.\n              The ^ operator converts lowercase letters matching pattern to uppercase; the , operator converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase.  The ^^ and ,, expansions convert each matched\n              character  in the expanded value; the ^ and , expansions match and convert only the first character in the expanded value.  If pattern is omitted, it is treated like a ?, which matches\n              every character.  If parameter is @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is  an\n              array variable subscripted with @ or *, the case modification operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.\n\n       ${parameter@operator}\n              Parameter  transformation.  The expansion is either a transformation of the value of parameter or information about parameter itself, depending on the value of operator.  Each operator\n              is a single letter:\n\n              Q      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter quoted in a format that can be reused as input.\n              E      The expansion is a string that is the value of parameter with backslash escape sequences expanded as with the $'...' quoting mechanism.\n              P      The expansion is a string that is the result of expanding the value of parameter as if it were a prompt string (see PROMPTING below).\n              A      The expansion is a string in the form of an assignment statement or declare command that, if evaluated, will recreate parameter with its attributes and value.\n              a      The expansion is a string consisting of flag values representing parameter's attributes.\n\n              If parameter is @ or *, the operation is applied to each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.  If parameter is an array variable subscripted with @ or\n              *, the operation is applied to each member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the resultant list.\n\n              The result of the expansion is subject to word splitting and pathname expansion as described below.\n\n   Command Substitution\n       Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command name.  There are two forms:\n\n              $(command)\n       or\n              `command`\n\n       Bash  performs the expansion by executing command in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.\n       Embedded newlines are not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.  The command substitution $(cat file) can be replaced by the equivalent but faster $((list).  The process list is run asynchronously, and its input or\n       output appears as a filename.  This filename is passed as an argument to the current command as the result of the expansion.  If the >(list) form is used, writing to the file will provide in‐\n       put for list.  If the , the default, then sequences of , , and  at the beginning and end of the results of the previous expansions are ignored, and any sequence of\n       IFS characters not at the beginning or end serves to delimit words.  If IFS has a value other than the default, then sequences of the whitespace characters space, tab, and newline are ignored\n       at the beginning and end of the word, as long as the whitespace character is in the value of IFS (an IFS whitespace character).  Any character in IFS that is not IFS  whitespace,  along  with\n       any adjacent IFS whitespace characters, delimits a field.  A sequence of IFS whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter.  If the value of IFS is null, no word splitting occurs.\n\n       Explicit null arguments (\"\" or '') are retained and passed to commands as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the expansion of parameters that have no values, are\n       removed.  If a parameter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument results and is retained and passed to a command as an empty string.  When a quoted null  argument  ap‐\n       pears as part of a word whose expansion is non-null, the null argument is removed.  That is, the word -d'' becomes -d after word splitting and null argument removal.\n\n       Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.\n\n   Pathname Expansion\n       After  word splitting, unless the -f option has been set, bash scans each word for the characters *, ?, and [.  If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a pattern, and\n       replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames matching the pattern (see Pattern Matching below).  If no matching filenames are found, and the shell option nullglob is not  enabled,\n       the  word is left unchanged.  If the nullglob option is set, and no matches are found, the word is removed.  If the failglob shell option is set, and no matches are found, an error message is\n       printed and the command is not executed.  If the shell option nocaseglob is enabled, the match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.  Note that  when  using  range\n       expressions  like [a-z] (see below), letters of the other case may be included, depending on the setting of LC_COLLATE.  When a pattern is used for pathname expansion, the character ``.''  at\n       the start of a name or immediately following a slash must be matched explicitly, unless the shell option dotglob is set.  The filenames ``.''  and ``..''  must always be  matched  explicitly,\n       even if dotglob is set.  In other cases, the ``.''  character is not treated specially.  When matching a pathname, the slash character must always be matched explicitly by a slash in the pat‐\n       tern, but in other matching contexts it can be matched by a special pattern character as described below under Pattern Matching.  See the description of shopt below under SHELL  BUILTIN  COM‐\n       MANDS for a description of the nocaseglob, nullglob, failglob, and dotglob shell options.\n\n       The GLOBIGNORE shell variable may be used to restrict the set of file names matching a pattern.  If GLOBIGNORE is set, each matching file name that also matches one of the patterns in GLOBIG‐\n       NORE is removed from the list of matches.  If the nocaseglob option is set, the matching against the patterns in GLOBIGNORE is performed without regard to  case.   The  filenames  ``.''   and\n       ``..''   are  always  ignored when GLOBIGNORE is set and not null.  However, setting GLOBIGNORE to a non-null value has the effect of enabling the dotglob shell option, so all other filenames\n       beginning with a ``.''  will match.  To get the old behavior of ignoring filenames beginning with a ``.'', make ``.*''  one of the patterns in GLOBIGNORE.  The dotglob option is disabled when\n       GLOBIGNORE is unset.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the extglob shell option.\n\n       Pattern Matching\n\n       Any  character  that  appears  in a pattern, other than the special pattern characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may not occur in a pattern.  A backslash escapes the\n       following character; the escaping backslash is discarded when matching.  The special pattern characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.\n\n       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:\n\n              *      Matches any string, including the null string.  When the globstar shell option is enabled, and * is used in a pathname expansion context, two adjacent *s used as a  single  pat‐\n                     tern will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.  If followed by a /, two adjacent *s will match only directories and subdirectories.\n              ?      Matches any single character.\n              [...]  Matches any one of the enclosed characters.  A pair of characters separated by a hyphen denotes a range expression; any character that falls between those two characters, inclu‐\n                     sive, using the current locale's collating sequence and character set, is matched.  If the first character following the [ is a !  or a ^ then  any  character  not  enclosed  is\n                     matched.  The sorting order of characters in range expressions is determined by the current locale and the values of the LC_COLLATE or LC_ALL shell variables, if set.  To obtain\n                     the traditional interpretation of range expressions, where [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd], set value of the LC_ALL shell variable to C, or enable the  globasciiranges  shell  op‐\n                     tion.  A - may be matched by including it as the first or last character in the set.  A ] may be matched by including it as the first character in the set.\n\n                     Within [ and ], character classes can be specified using the syntax [:class:], where class is one of the following classes defined in the POSIX standard:\n                     alnum alpha ascii blank cntrl digit graph lower print punct space upper word xdigit\n                     A character class matches any character belonging to that class.  The word character class matches letters, digits, and the character _.\n\n                     Within  [  and ], an equivalence class can be specified using the syntax [=c=], which matches all characters with the same collation weight (as defined by the current locale) as\n                     the character c.\n\n                     Within [ and ], the syntax [.symbol.] matches the collating symbol symbol.\n\n       If the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin, several extended pattern matching operators are recognized.  In the following description, a pattern-list is a list of  one  or\n       more patterns separated by a |.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more of the following sub-patterns:\n\n              ?(pattern-list)\n                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns\n              *(pattern-list)\n                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns\n              +(pattern-list)\n                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns\n              @(pattern-list)\n                     Matches one of the given patterns\n              !(pattern-list)\n                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns\n\n       Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow, especially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain multiple matches.  Using separate matches against\n       shorter strings, or using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.\n\n   Quote Removal\n       After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the characters \\, ', and \" that did not result from one of the above expansions are removed.\n\nREDIRECTION\n       Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell.  Redirection allows commands' file handles to  be  duplicated,  opened,\n       closed,  made  to  refer to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and writes to.  Redirection may also be used to modify file handles in the current shell execution\n       environment.  The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple command or may follow a command.  Redirections are processed in the order  they  appear,  from\n       left to right.\n\n       Each redirection that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may instead be preceded by a word of the form {varname}.  In this case, for each redirection operator except >&- and &- or , the redirection refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).\n\n       The word following the redirection operator in the following descriptions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,  command\n       substitution, arithmetic expansion, quote removal, pathname expansion, and word splitting.  If it expands to more than one word, bash reports an error.\n\n       Note that the order of redirections is significant.  For example, the command\n\n              ls > dirlist 2>&1\n\n       directs both standard output and standard error to the file dirlist, while the command\n\n              ls 2>&1 > dirlist\n\n       directs only the standard output to file dirlist, because the standard error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard output was redirected to dirlist.\n\n       Bash  handles  several  filenames  specially  when they are used in redirections, as described in the following table.  If the operating system on which bash is running provides these special\n       files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with the behavior described below.\n\n              /dev/fd/fd\n                     If fd is a valid integer, file descriptor fd is duplicated.\n              /dev/stdin\n                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.\n              /dev/stdout\n                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.\n              /dev/stderr\n                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.\n              /dev/tcp/host/port\n                     If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, bash attempts to open the corresponding TCP socket.\n              /dev/udp/host/port\n                     If host is a valid hostname or Internet address, and port is an integer port number or service name, bash attempts to open the corresponding UDP socket.\n\n       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.\n\n       Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care, as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally.\n\n       Note that the exec builtin command can make redirections take effect in the current shell.\n\n   Redirecting Input\n       Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for reading on file descriptor n, or the standard input (file descriptor 0) if n is not  speci‐\n       fied.\n\n       The general format for redirecting input is:\n\n              [n]word\n\n       If the redirection operator is >, and the noclobber option to the set builtin has been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose name results from the expansion of word exists  and\n       is  a  regular file.  If the redirection operator is >|, or the redirection operator is > and the noclobber option to the set builtin command is not enabled, the redirection is attempted even\n       if the file named by word exists.\n\n   Appending Redirected Output\n       Redirection of output in this fashion causes the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for appending on file descriptor n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1)\n       if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.\n\n       The general format for appending output is:\n\n              [n]>>word\n\n   Redirecting Standard Output and Standard Error\n       This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the file whose name is the expansion of word.\n\n       There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard error:\n\n              &>word\n       and\n              >&word\n\n       Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equivalent to\n\n              >word 2>&1\n\n       When using the second form, word may not expand to a number or -.  If it does, other redirection operators apply (see Duplicating File Descriptors below) for compatibility reasons.\n\n   Appending Standard Output and Standard Error\n       This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1) and the standard error output (file descriptor 2) to be appended to the file whose name is the expansion of word.\n\n       The format for appending standard output and standard error is:\n\n              &>>word\n\n       This is semantically equivalent to\n\n              >>word 2>&1\n\n       (see Duplicating File Descriptors below).\n\n   Here Documents\n       This  type of redirection instructs the shell to read input from the current source until a line containing only delimiter (with no trailing blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up to that\n       point are then used as the standard input (or file descriptor n if n is specified) for a command.\n\n       The format of here-documents is:\n\n              [n] is ignored, and \\ must be used to quote the characters \\, $, and `.\n\n       If the redirection operator is &word\n\n       is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If n is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is used.  If the digits in word do not specify a file  descriptor  open\n       for  output,  a  redirection  error occurs.  If word evaluates to -, file descriptor n is closed.  As a special case, if n is omitted, and word does not expand to one or more digits or -, the\n       standard output and standard error are redirected as described previously.\n\n   Moving File Descriptors\n       The redirection operator\n\n              [n]&digit-\n\n       moves the file descriptor digit to file descriptor n, or the standard output (file descriptor 1) if n is not specified.\n\n   Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing\n       The redirection operator\n\n              [n]<>word\n\n       causes the file whose name is the expansion of word to be opened for both reading and writing on file descriptor n, or on file descriptor 0 if n is not specified.  If the file does not exist,\n       it is created.\n\nALIASES\n       Aliases  allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a simple command.  The shell maintains a list of aliases that may be set and unset with the alias and\n       unalias builtin commands (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  The first word of each simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.  If so, that word is  replaced  by  the\n       text of the alias.  The characters /, $, `, and = and any of the shell metacharacters or quoting characters listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may contain any\n       valid shell input, including shell metacharacters.  The first word of the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word that is identical to an alias being expanded  is  not  expanded  a\n       second  time.  This means that one may alias ls to ls -F, for instance, and bash does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.  If the last character of the alias value is a blank,\n       then the next command word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.\n\n       Aliases are created and listed with the alias command, and removed with the unalias command.\n\n       There is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If arguments are needed, a shell function should be used (see FUNCTIONS below).\n\n       Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless the expand_aliases shell option is set using shopt (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\n       The rules concerning the definition and use of aliases are somewhat confusing.  Bash always reads at least one complete line of input, and all lines that make up a  compound  command,  before\n       executing  any  of  the  commands on that line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore, an alias definition appearing on the\n       same line as another command does not take effect until the next line of input is read.  The commands following the alias definition on that line are not affected by the new alias.  This  be‐\n       havior  is  also  an  issue when functions are executed.  Aliases are expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function is executed, because a function definition is itself a\n       command.  As a consequence, aliases defined in a function are not available until after that function is executed.  To be safe, always put alias definitions on a separate line, and do not use\n       alias in compound commands.\n\n       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.\n\nFUNCTIONS\n       A  shell  function,  defined  as described above under SHELL GRAMMAR, stores a series of commands for later execution.  When the name of a shell function is used as a simple command name, the\n       list of commands associated with that function name is executed.  Functions are executed in the context of the current shell; no new process is created to interpret them (contrast  this  with\n       the execution of a shell script).  When a function is executed, the arguments to the function become the positional parameters during its execution.  The special parameter # is updated to re‐\n       flect the change.  Special parameter 0 is unchanged.  The first element of the FUNCNAME variable is set to the name of the function while the function is executing.\n\n       All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its caller with these exceptions: the DEBUG and RETURN traps (see the description of the trap builtin\n       under  SHELL  BUILTIN COMMANDS below) are not inherited unless the function has been given the trace attribute (see the description of the declare builtin below) or the -o functrace shell op‐\n       tion has been enabled with the set builtin (in which case all functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps), and the ERR trap is not inherited unless the -o errtrace shell option has been en‐\n       abled.\n\n       Variables  local  to the function may be declared with the local builtin command.  Ordinarily, variables and their values are shared between the function and its caller.  If a variable is de‐\n       clared local, the variable's visible scope is restricted to that function and its children (including the functions it calls).  Local variables \"shadow\" variables with the same name  declared\n       at previous scopes.  For instance, a local variable declared in a function hides a global variable of the same name: references and assignments refer to the local variable, leaving the global\n       variable unmodified.  When the function returns, the global variable is once again visible.\n\n       The shell uses dynamic scoping to control a variable's visibility within functions.  With dynamic scoping, visible variables and their values are a result of the sequence  of  function  calls\n       that caused execution to reach the current function.  The value of a variable that a function sees depends on its value within its caller, if any, whether that caller is the \"global\" scope or\n       another shell function.  This is also the value that a local variable declaration \"shadows\", and the value that is restored when the function returns.\n\n       For example, if a variable var is declared as local in function func1, and func1 calls another function func2, references to var made from within func2 will resolve to the local variable  var\n       from func1, shadowing any global variable named var.\n\n       The unset builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable is local to the current scope, unset will unset it; otherwise the unset will refer to the variable found in any calling\n       scope as described above.  If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it will remain so until it is reset in that scope or until the function returns.  Once the function returns,  any\n       instance  of  the variable at a previous scope will become visible.  If the unset acts on a variable at a previous scope, any instance of a variable with that name that had been shadowed will\n       become visible.\n\n       The FUNCNEST variable, if set to a numeric value greater than 0, defines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that exceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.\n\n       If the builtin command return is executed in a function, the function completes and execution resumes with the next command after the function call.  Any command associated  with  the  RETURN\n       trap  is  executed  before  execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter # are restored to the values they had prior to the\n       function's execution.\n\n       Function names and definitions may be listed with the -f option to the declare or typeset builtin commands.  The -F option to declare or typeset will list the function names only (and option‐\n       ally  the  source file and line number, if the extdebug shell option is enabled).  Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined with the -f option to the export\n       builtin.  A function definition may be deleted using the -f option to the unset builtin.\n\n       Functions may be recursive.  The FUNCNEST variable may be used to limit the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number of function invocations.  By default, no limit is  imposed\n       on the number of recursive calls.\n\nARITHMETIC EVALUATION\n       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under certain circumstances (see the let and declare builtin commands, the (( compound command, and Arithmetic Expansion).  Evaluation\n       is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error.  The operators and their precedence, associativity,  and  values  are  the\n       same as in the C language.  The following list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.\n\n       id++ id--\n              variable post-increment and post-decrement\n       - +    unary minus and plus\n       ++id --id\n              variable pre-increment and pre-decrement\n       ! ~    logical and bitwise negation\n       **     exponentiation\n       * / %  multiplication, division, remainder\n       + -    addition, subtraction\n       >  left and right bitwise shifts\n       = \n              comparison\n       == !=  equality and inequality\n       &      bitwise AND\n       ^      bitwise exclusive OR\n       |      bitwise OR\n       &&     logical AND\n       ||     logical OR\n       expr?expr:expr\n              conditional operator\n       = *= /= %= += -= >= &= ^= |=\n              assignment\n       expr1 , expr2\n              comma\n\n       Shell variables are allowed as operands; parameter expansion is performed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell variables may also be referenced by name without us‐\n       ing the parameter expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates to 0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax.  The value of  a  variable  is\n       evaluated  as an arithmetic expression when it is referenced, or when a variable which has been given the integer attribute using declare -i is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates to 0.\n       A shell variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression.\n\n       Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as octal numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise, numbers take the form [base#]n, where the optional base is a  decimal  number\n       between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and n is a number in that base.  If base# is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When specifying n, the digits greater than 9 are represented by\n       the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _, in that order.  If base is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and uppercase letters may be used interchangeably to  represent  numbers\n       between 10 and 35.\n\n       Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above.\n\nCONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS\n       Conditional expressions are used by the [[ compound command and the test and [ builtin commands to test file attributes and perform string and arithmetic comparisons.  The test abd [ commands\n       determine their behavior based on the number of arguments; see the descriptions of those commands for any other command-specific actions.\n\n       Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary primaries.  Bash handles several filenames specially when they are used in expressions.  If the operating system  on  which  bash  is\n       running  provides these special files, bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them internally with this behavior: If any file argument to one of the primaries is of the form /dev/fd/n,\n       then file descriptor n is checked.  If the file argument to one of the primaries is one of /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, or /dev/stderr, file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively, is checked.\n\n       Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow symbolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the link itself.\n\n       When used with [[, the  operators sort lexicographically using the current locale.  The test command sorts using ASCII ordering.\n\n       -a file\n              True if file exists.\n       -b file\n              True if file exists and is a block special file.\n       -c file\n              True if file exists and is a character special file.\n       -d file\n              True if file exists and is a directory.\n       -e file\n              True if file exists.\n       -f file\n              True if file exists and is a regular file.\n       -g file\n              True if file exists and is set-group-id.\n       -h file\n              True if file exists and is a symbolic link.\n       -k file\n              True if file exists and its ``sticky'' bit is set.\n       -p file\n              True if file exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).\n       -r file\n              True if file exists and is readable.\n       -s file\n              True if file exists and has a size greater than zero.\n       -t fd  True if file descriptor fd is open and refers to a terminal.\n       -u file\n              True if file exists and its set-user-id bit is set.\n       -w file\n              True if file exists and is writable.\n       -x file\n              True if file exists and is executable.\n       -G file\n              True if file exists and is owned by the effective group id.\n       -L file\n              True if file exists and is a symbolic link.\n       -N file\n              True if file exists and has been modified since it was last read.\n       -O file\n              True if file exists and is owned by the effective user id.\n       -S file\n              True if file exists and is a socket.\n       file1 -ef file2\n              True if file1 and file2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.\n       file1 -nt file2\n              True if file1 is newer (according to modification date) than file2, or if file1 exists and file2 does not.\n       file1 -ot file2\n              True if file1 is older than file2, or if file2 exists and file1 does not.\n       -o optname\n              True if the shell option optname is enabled.  See the list of options under the description of the -o option to the set builtin below.\n       -v varname\n              True if the shell variable varname is set (has been assigned a value).\n       -R varname\n              True if the shell variable varname is set and is a name reference.\n       -z string\n              True if the length of string is zero.\n       string\n       -n string\n              True if the length of string is non-zero.\n\n       string1 == string2\n       string1 = string2\n              True if the strings are equal.  = should be used with the test command for POSIX conformance.  When used with the [[ command, this performs pattern matching as  described  above  (Com‐\n              pound Commands).\n\n       string1 != string2\n              True if the strings are not equal.\n\n       string1  string2\n              True if string1 sorts after string2 lexicographically.\n\n       arg1 OP arg2\n              OP  is  one  of  -eq,  -ne,  -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge.  These arithmetic binary operators return true if arg1 is equal to, not equal to, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or\n              greater than or equal to arg2, respectively.  Arg1 and arg2 may be positive or negative integers.  When used with the [[ command, Arg1 and Arg2 are evaluated as arithmetic  expressions\n              (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above).\n\nSIMPLE COMMAND EXPANSION\n       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following expansions, assignments, and redirections, from left to right.\n\n       1.     The words that the parser has marked as variable assignments (those preceding the command name) and redirections are saved for later processing.\n\n       2.     The  words that are not variable assignments or redirections are expanded.  If any words remain after expansion, the first word is taken to be the name of the command and the remaining\n              words are the arguments.\n\n       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under REDIRECTION.\n\n       4.     The text after the = in each variable assignment undergoes tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal before being assigned  to\n              the variable.\n\n       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current shell environment.  Otherwise, the variables are added to the environment of the executed command and do not affect the\n       current shell environment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a value to a readonly variable, an error occurs, and the command exits with a non-zero status.\n\n       If no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not affect the current shell environment.  A redirection error causes the command to exit with a non-zero status.\n\n       If there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one of the expansions contained a  command  substitution,  the  exit\n       status of the command is the exit status of the last command substitution performed.  If there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of zero.\n\nCOMMAND EXECUTION\n       After a command has been split into words, if it results in a simple command and an optional list of arguments, the following actions are taken.\n\n       If  the  command  name  contains no slashes, the shell attempts to locate it.  If there exists a shell function by that name, that function is invoked as described above in FUNCTIONS.  If the\n       name does not match a function, the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If a match is found, that builtin is invoked.\n\n       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains no slashes, bash searches each element of the PATH for a directory containing an executable file by that name.  Bash uses a\n       hash  table to remember the full pathnames of executable files (see hash under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  A full search of the directories in PATH is performed only if the command is not\n       found in the hash table.  If the search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function named command_not_found_handle.  If that function exists, it is invoked in a  separate\n       execution  environment with the original command and the original command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit status becomes the exit status of that subshell.  If that func‐\n       tion is not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit status of 127.\n\n       If the search is successful, or if the command name contains one or more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execution environment.  Argument 0  is  set  to  the  name\n       given, and the remaining arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.\n\n       If  this  execution  fails  because the file is not in executable format, and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a shell script, a file containing shell commands.  A subshell is\n       spawned to execute it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with the exception that the  locations  of  commands\n       remembered by the parent (see hash below under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS) are retained by the child.\n\n       If  the  program is a file beginning with #!, the remainder of the first line specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the specified interpreter on operating systems that\n       do not handle this executable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the first line of the program,  fol‐\n       lowed by the name of the program, followed by the command arguments, if any.\n\nCOMMAND EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT\n       The shell has an execution environment, which consists of the following:\n\n       •      open files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by redirections supplied to the exec builtin\n\n       •      the current working directory as set by cd, pushd, or popd, or inherited by the shell at invocation\n\n       •      the file creation mode mask as set by umask or inherited from the shell's parent\n\n       •      current traps set by trap\n\n       •      shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with set or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment\n\n       •      shell functions defined during execution or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment\n\n       •      options enabled at invocation (either by default or with command-line arguments) or by set\n\n       •      options enabled by shopt\n\n       •      shell aliases defined with alias\n\n       •      various process IDs, including those of background jobs, the value of $$, and the value of PPID\n\n       When  a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment that consists of the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the\n       values are inherited from the shell.\n\n       •      the shell's open files, plus any modifications and additions specified by redirections to the command\n\n       •      the current working directory\n\n       •      the file creation mode mask\n\n       •      shell variables and functions marked for export, along with variables exported for the command, passed in the environment\n\n       •      traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored\n\n       A command invoked in this separate environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.\n\n       Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught\n       by  the shell are reset to the values that the shell inherited from its parent at invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also executed in a subshell environ‐\n       ment.  Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.\n\n       Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of the -e option from the parent shell.  When not in posix mode, bash clears the -e option in such subshells.\n\n       If a command is followed by a & and job control is not active, the default standard input for the command is the empty file /dev/null.  Otherwise, the invoked command inherits  the  file  de‐\n       scriptors of the calling shell as modified by redirections.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n       When a program is invoked it is given an array of strings called the environment.  This is a list of name-value pairs, of the form name=value.\n\n       The  shell  provides  several ways to manipulate the environment.  On invocation, the shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter for each name found, automatically marking it for\n       export to child processes.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  The export and declare -x commands allow parameters and functions to be added to and deleted from the environment.   If\n       the  value  of a parameter in the environment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, replacing the old.  The environment inherited by any executed command consists of the\n       shell's initial environment, whose values may be modified in the shell, less any pairs removed by the unset command, plus any additions via the export and declare -x commands.\n\n       The environment for any simple command or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described above in PARAMETERS.  These assignment statements  af‐\n       fect only the environment seen by that command.\n\n       If the -k option is set (see the set builtin command below), then all parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.\n\n       When bash invokes an external command, the variable _ is set to the full filename of the command and passed to that command in its environment.\n\nEXIT STATUS\n       The  exit  status  of an executed command is the value returned by the waitpid system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between 0 and 255, though, as explained below, the shell\n       may use values above 125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands are also limited to this range.  Under certain circumstances, the shell will use special values to\n       indicate specific failure modes.\n\n       For  the  shell's  purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status has succeeded.  An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero exit status indicates failure.  When a command\n       terminates on a fatal signal N, bash uses the value of 128+N as the exit status.\n\n       If a command is not found, the child process created to execute it returns a status of 127.  If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.\n\n       If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection, the exit status is greater than zero.\n\n       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (true) if successful, and non-zero (false) if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins return an exit status of 2  to  indicate  incorrect\n       usage, generally invalid options or missing arguments.\n\n       Bash itself returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero value.  See also the exit builtin command below.\n\nSIGNALS\n       When  bash  is  interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores SIGTERM (so that kill 0 does not kill an interactive shell), and SIGINT is caught and handled (so that the wait builtin is\n       interruptible).  In all cases, bash ignores SIGQUIT.  If job control is in effect, bash ignores SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.\n\n       Non-builtin commands run by bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent.  When job control is not in effect, asynchronous  commands  ignore  SIGINT  and\n       SIGQUIT in addition to these inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals SIGTTIN, SIGTTOU, and SIGTSTP.\n\n       The  shell  exits  by default upon receipt of a SIGHUP.  Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the SIGHUP to all jobs, running or stopped.  Stopped jobs are sent SIGCONT to ensure that\n       they receive the SIGHUP.  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to a particular job, it should be removed from the jobs table with the disown builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below)\n       or marked to not receive SIGHUP using disown -h.\n\n       If the huponexit shell option has been set with shopt, bash sends a SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.\n\n       If bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the command completes.  When bash is waiting for an asyn‐\n       chronous command via the wait builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set will cause the wait builtin to return immediately with an exit status greater than 128,  immedi‐\n       ately after which the trap is executed.\n\nJOB CONTROL\n       Job  control refers to the ability to selectively stop (suspend) the execution of processes and continue (resume) their execution at a later point.  A user typically employs this facility via\n       an interactive interface supplied jointly by the operating system kernel's terminal driver and bash.\n\n       The shell associates a job with each pipeline.  It keeps a table of currently executing jobs, which may be listed with the jobs command.  When bash starts a job asynchronously (in  the  back‐\n       ground), it prints a line that looks like:\n\n              [1] 25647\n\n       indicating  that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All of the processes in a single pipeline are members\n       of the same job.  Bash uses the job abstraction as the basis for job control.\n\n       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job control, the operating system maintains the notion of a current terminal process group ID.  Members of this process  group  (pro‐\n       cesses  whose  process group ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-generated signals such as SIGINT.  These processes are said to be in the foreground.  Back‐\n       ground processes are those whose process group ID differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-generated signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or,\n       if  the  user  so  specifies with stty tostop, write to the terminal.  Background processes which attempt to read from (write to when stty tostop is in effect) the terminal are sent a SIGTTIN\n       (SIGTTOU) signal by the kernel's terminal driver, which, unless caught, suspends the process.\n\n       If the operating system on which bash is running supports job control, bash contains facilities to use it.  Typing the suspend character (typically ^Z, Control-Z) while a process  is  running\n       causes  that process to be stopped and returns control to bash.  Typing the delayed suspend character (typically ^Y, Control-Y) causes the process to be stopped when it attempts to read input\n       from the terminal, and control to be returned to bash.  The user may then manipulate the state of this job, using the bg command to continue it in the background, the fg command  to  continue\n       it in the foreground, or the kill command to kill it.  A ^Z takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing pending output and typeahead to be discarded.\n\n       There  are  a  number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The character % introduces a job specification (jobspec).  Job number n may be referred to as %n.  A job may also be referred to\n       using a prefix of the name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command line.  For example, %ce refers to a stopped ce job.  If a prefix matches more than one job,  bash\n       reports an error.  Using %?ce, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the string ce in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one job, bash reports an error.  The sym‐\n       bols %% and %+ refer to the shell's notion of the current job, which is the last job stopped while it was in the foreground or started in the background.  The previous job may  be  referenced\n       using  %-.   If  there  is  only a single job, %+ and %- can both be used to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g., the output of the jobs command), the current job is always\n       flagged with a +, and the previous job with a -.  A single % (with no accompanying job specification) also refers to the current job.\n\n       Simply naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: %1 is a synonym for ``fg %1'', bringing job 1 from the background into the foreground.  Similarly, ``%1 &'' resumes job  1  in\n       the background, equivalent to ``bg %1''.\n\n       The  shell  learns  immediately  whenever  a job changes state.  Normally, bash waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes in a job's status so as to not interrupt any\n       other output.  If the -b option to the set builtin command is enabled, bash reports such changes immediately.  Any trap on SIGCHLD is executed for each child that exits.\n\n       If an attempt to exit bash is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the checkjobs shell option has been enabled using the shopt builtin, running), the shell prints a warning  message,  and,  if\n       the  checkjobs  option  is  enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.  The jobs command may then be used to inspect their status.  If a second attempt to exit is made without an intervening\n       command, the shell does not print another warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.\n\n       When the shell is waiting for a job or process using the wait builtin, and job control is enabled, wait will return when the job changes state. The -f option will force wait to wait until the\n       job or process terminates before returning.\n\nPROMPTING\n       When  executing interactively, bash displays the primary prompt PS1 when it is ready to read a command, and the secondary prompt PS2 when it needs more input to complete a command.  Bash dis‐\n       plays PS0 after it reads a command but before executing it.  Bash displays PS4 as described above before tracing each command when the -x option is enabled.  Bash allows these prompt  strings\n       to be customized by inserting a number of backslash-escaped special characters that are decoded as follows:\n              \\a     an ASCII bell character (07)\n              \\d     the date in \"Weekday Month Date\" format (e.g., \"Tue May 26\")\n              \\D{format}\n                     the format is passed to strftime(3) and the result is inserted into the prompt string; an empty format results in a locale-specific time representation.  The braces are required\n              \\e     an ASCII escape character (033)\n              \\h     the hostname up to the first `.'\n              \\H     the hostname\n              \\j     the number of jobs currently managed by the shell\n              \\l     the basename of the shell's terminal device name\n              \\n     newline\n              \\r     carriage return\n              \\s     the name of the shell, the basename of $0 (the portion following the final slash)\n              \\t     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format\n              \\T     the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format\n              \\@     the current time in 12-hour am/pm format\n              \\A     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format\n              \\u     the username of the current user\n              \\v     the version of bash (e.g., 2.00)\n              \\V     the release of bash, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)\n              \\w     the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde (uses the value of the PROMPT_DIRTRIM variable)\n              \\W     the basename of the current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde\n              \\!     the history number of this command\n              \\#     the command number of this command\n              \\$     if the effective UID is 0, a #, otherwise a $\n              \\nnn   the character corresponding to the octal number nnn\n              \\\\     a backslash\n              \\[     begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which could be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the prompt\n              \\]     end a sequence of non-printing characters\n\n       The command number and the history number are usually different: the history number of a command is its position in the history list, which may include commands restored from the history file\n       (see HISTORY below), while the command number is the position in the sequence of commands executed during the current shell session.  After the string is decoded, it is expanded via parameter\n       expansion,  command  substitution,  arithmetic  expansion, and quote removal, subject to the value of the promptvars shell option (see the description of the shopt command under SHELL BUILTIN\n       COMMANDS below).\n\nREADLINE\n       This is the library that handles reading input when using an interactive shell, unless the --noediting option is given at shell invocation.  Line editing is also used when using the -e option\n       to the read builtin.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of Emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be enabled at any time using\n       the -o emacs or -o vi options to the set builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  To turn off line editing after the shell is running, use the +o  emacs  or  +o  vi  options  to  the  set\n       builtin.\n\n   Readline Notation\n       In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.  Control keys are denoted by C-key, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Similarly, meta keys are denoted by M-key, so M-x means\n       Meta-X.  (On keyboards without a meta key, M-x means ESC x, i.e., press the Escape key then the x key.  This makes ESC the meta prefix.  The combination M-C-x means  ESC-Control-x,  or  press\n       the Escape key then hold the Control key while pressing the x key.)\n\n       Readline  commands  may be given numeric arguments, which normally act as a repeat count.  Sometimes, however, it is the sign of the argument that is significant.  Passing a negative argument\n       to a command that acts in the forward direction (e.g., kill-line) causes that command to act in a backward direction.  Commands whose behavior with arguments deviates from this are noted  be‐\n       low.\n\n       When  a command is described as killing text, the text deleted is saved for possible future retrieval (yanking).  The killed text is saved in a kill ring.  Consecutive kills cause the text to\n       be accumulated into one unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.\n\n   Readline Initialization\n       Readline is customized by putting commands in an initialization file (the inputrc file).  The name of this file is taken from the value of the INPUTRC variable.  If that  variable  is  unset,\n       the  default is ~/.inputrc.  When a program which uses the readline library starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key bindings and variables are set.  There are only a few basic\n       constructs allowed in the readline initialization file.  Blank lines are ignored.  Lines beginning with a # are comments.  Lines beginning with a $  indicate  conditional  constructs.   Other\n       lines denote key bindings and variable settings.\n\n       The default key-bindings may be changed with an inputrc file.  Other programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.\n\n       For example, placing\n\n              M-Control-u: universal-argument\n       or\n              C-Meta-u: universal-argument\n       into the inputrc would make M-C-u execute the readline command universal-argument.\n\n       The following symbolic character names are recognized: RUBOUT, DEL, ESC, LFD, NEWLINE, RET, RETURN, SPC, SPACE, and TAB.\n\n       In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a macro).\n\n   Readline Key Bindings\n       The  syntax for controlling key bindings in the inputrc file is simple.  All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a macro and a key sequence to which it should be bound.\n       The name may be specified in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with Meta- or Control- prefixes, or as a key sequence.\n\n       When using the form keyname:function-name or macro, keyname is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:\n\n              Control-u: universal-argument\n              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word\n              Control-o: \"> output\"\n\n       In the above example, C-u is bound to the function universal-argument, M-DEL is bound to the function backward-kill-word, and C-o is bound to run the macro expressed on the  right  hand  side\n       (that is, to insert the text ``> output'' into the line).\n\n       In  the  second form, \"keyseq\":function-name or macro, keyseq differs from keyname above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence may be specified by placing the sequence within double\n       quotes.  Some GNU Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the symbolic character names are not recognized.\n\n              \"\\C-u\": universal-argument\n              \"\\C-x\\C-r\": re-read-init-file\n              \"\\e[11~\": \"Function Key 1\"\n\n       In this example, C-u is again bound to the function universal-argument.  C-x C-r is bound to the function re-read-init-file, and ESC [ 1 1 ~ is bound to insert the text ``Function Key 1''.\n\n       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is\n              \\C-    control prefix\n              \\M-    meta prefix\n              \\e     an escape character\n              \\\\     backslash\n              \\\"     literal \"\n              \\'     literal '\n\n       In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of backslash escapes is available:\n              \\a     alert (bell)\n              \\b     backspace\n              \\d     delete\n              \\f     form feed\n              \\n     newline\n              \\r     carriage return\n              \\t     horizontal tab\n              \\v     vertical tab\n              \\nnn   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three digits)\n              \\xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)\n\n       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name.  In the macro body, the backslash  es‐\n       capes described above are expanded.  Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text, including \" and '.\n\n       Bash allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or modified with the bind builtin command.  The editing mode may be switched during interactive use by using the -o option to the\n       set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).\n\n   Readline Variables\n       Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behavior.  A variable may be set in the inputrc file with a statement of the form\n\n              set variable-name value\n\n       Except where noted, readline variables can take the values On or Off (without regard to case).  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.  When a variable value is read, empty or null  values,\n       \"on\" (case-insensitive), and \"1\" are equivalent to On.  All other values are equivalent to Off.  The variables and their default values are:\n\n       bell-style (audible)\n              Controls  what  happens when readline wants to ring the terminal bell.  If set to none, readline never rings the bell.  If set to visible, readline uses a visible bell if one is avail‐\n              able.  If set to audible, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.\n       bind-tty-special-chars (On)\n              If set to On, readline attempts to bind the control characters treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their readline equivalents.\n       blink-matching-paren (Off)\n              If set to On, readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to an opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.\n       colored-completion-prefix (Off)\n              If set to On, when listing completions, readline displays the common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color.  The color definitions are taken from the  value\n              of the LS_COLORS environment variable.\n       colored-stats (Off)\n              If  set  to  On, readline displays possible completions using different colors to indicate their file type.  The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment\n              variable.\n       comment-begin (``#'')\n              The string that is inserted when the readline insert-comment command is executed.  This command is bound to M-# in emacs mode and to # in vi command mode.\n       completion-display-width (-1)\n              The number of screen columns used to display possible matches when performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value\n              of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line.  The default value is -1.\n       completion-ignore-case (Off)\n              If set to On, readline performs filename matching and completion in a case-insensitive fashion.\n       completion-map-case (Off)\n              If set to On, and completion-ignore-case is enabled, readline treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.\n       completion-prefix-display-length (0)\n              The  length  in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible completions that is displayed without modification.  When set to a value greater than zero, common prefixes longer\n              than this value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.\n       completion-query-items (100)\n              This determines when the user is queried about viewing the number of possible completions generated by the possible-completions command.  It may be set to  any  integer  value  greater\n              than or equal to zero.  If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to the value of this variable, the user is asked whether or not he wishes to view them; otherwise\n              they are simply listed on the terminal.\n       convert-meta (On)\n              If set to On, readline will convert characters with the eighth bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and prefixing an escape character (in effect,  using  escape\n              as the meta prefix).  The default is On, but readline will set it to Off if the locale contains eight-bit characters.\n       disable-completion (Off)\n              If set to On, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion characters will be inserted into the line as if they had been mapped to self-insert.\n       echo-control-characters (On)\n              When set to On, on operating systems that indicate they support it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the keyboard.\n       editing-mode (emacs)\n              Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings similar to Emacs or vi.  editing-mode can be set to either emacs or vi.\n       emacs-mode-string (@)\n              If  the  show-mode-in-prompt  variable  is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when emacs editing mode is active.  The value is ex‐\n              panded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  Use the \\1 and \\2 escapes to begin and end sequences of  non-\n              printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.\n       enable-bracketed-paste (Off)\n              When  set  to  On,  readline will configure the terminal in a way that will enable it to insert each paste into the editing buffer as a single string of characters, instead of treating\n              each character as if it had been read from the keyboard.  This can prevent pasted characters from being interpreted as editing commands.\n       enable-keypad (Off)\n              When set to On, readline will try to enable the application keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the arrow keys.\n       enable-meta-key (On)\n              When set to On, readline will try to enable any meta modifier key the terminal claims to support when it is called.  On many terminals, the meta key is used to send  eight-bit  charac‐\n              ters.\n       expand-tilde (Off)\n              If set to On, tilde expansion is performed when readline attempts word completion.\n       history-preserve-point (Off)\n              If set to On, the history code attempts to place point at the same location on each history line retrieved with previous-history or next-history.\n       history-size (unset)\n              Set  the  maximum  number  of history entries saved in the history list.  If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less\n              than zero, the number of history entries is not limited.  By default, the number of history entries is set to the value of the HISTSIZE shell variable.  If an attempt is  made  to  set\n              history-size to a non-numeric value, the maximum number of history entries will be set to 500.\n       horizontal-scroll-mode (Off)\n              When set to On, makes readline use a single line for display, scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it becomes longer than the screen width rather than wrapping\n              to a new line.\n       input-meta (Off)\n              If set to On, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it will not strip the eighth bit from the characters it reads), regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The\n              name meta-flag is a synonym for this variable.  The default is Off, but readline will set it to On if the locale contains eight-bit characters.\n       isearch-terminators (``C-[C-J'')\n              The  string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without subsequently executing the character as a command.  If this variable has not been given a value, the char‐\n              acters ESC and C-J will terminate an incremental search.\n       keymap (emacs)\n              Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap names is emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-command, and vi-insert.  vi is equivalent to vi-command;  emacs\n              is equivalent to emacs-standard.  The default value is emacs; the value of editing-mode also affects the default keymap.\n       keyseq-timeout (500)\n              Specifies the duration readline will wait for a character when reading an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using the input read so far, or can take ad‐\n              ditional input to complete a longer key sequence).  If no input is received within the timeout, readline will use the shorter but complete key sequence.  The value is specified in mil‐\n              liseconds,  so a value of 1000 means that readline will wait one second for additional input.  If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value,\n              readline will wait until another key is pressed to decide which key sequence to complete.\n       mark-directories (On)\n              If set to On, completed directory names have a slash appended.\n       mark-modified-lines (Off)\n              If set to On, history lines that have been modified are displayed with a preceding asterisk (*).\n       mark-symlinked-directories (Off)\n              If set to On, completed names which are symbolic links to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of mark-directories).\n       match-hidden-files (On)\n              This variable, when set to On, causes readline to match files whose names begin with a `.' (hidden files) when performing filename completion.  If set to Off, the leading `.'  must  be\n              supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.\n       menu-complete-display-prefix (Off)\n              If set to On, menu completion displays the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list.\n       output-meta (Off)\n              If  set  to On, readline will display characters with the eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.  The default is Off, but readline will set it to On if\n              the locale contains eight-bit characters.\n       page-completions (On)\n              If set to On, readline uses an internal more-like pager to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.\n       print-completions-horizontally (Off)\n              If set to On, readline will display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.\n       revert-all-at-newline (Off)\n              If set to On, readline will undo all changes to history lines before returning when accept-line is executed.  By default, history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists\n              across calls to readline.\n       show-all-if-ambiguous (Off)\n              This  alters  the  default behavior of the completion functions.  If set to On, words which have more than one possible completion cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of\n              ringing the bell.\n       show-all-if-unmodified (Off)\n              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in a fashion similar to show-all-if-ambiguous.  If set to On, words which have more than one  possible  completion  without\n              any possible partial completion (the possible completions don't share a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.\n       show-mode-in-prompt (Off)\n              If  set  to  On,  add  a  string  to  the  beginning  of  the  prompt  indicating  the  editing  mode:  emacs,  vi  command, or vi insertion.  The mode strings are user-settable (e.g.,\n              emacs-mode-string).\n       skip-completed-text (Off)\n              If set to On, this alters the default completion behavior when inserting a single match into the line.  It's only active when performing completion in the middle of  a  word.   If  en‐\n              abled,  readline  does not insert characters from the completion that match characters after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word following the cursor are not du‐\n              plicated.\n       vi-cmd-mode-string ((cmd))\n              If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.  The\n              value  is  expanded  like  a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  Use the \\1 and \\2 escapes to begin and end se‐\n              quences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.\n       vi-ins-mode-string ((ins))\n              If the show-mode-in-prompt variable is enabled, this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt when vi editing mode is active and  in  insertion  mode.\n              The value is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and backslash escape sequences is available.  Use the \\1 and \\2 escapes to begin and end se‐\n              quences of non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the mode string.\n       visible-stats (Off)\n              If set to On, a character denoting a file's type as reported by stat(2) is appended to the filename when listing possible completions.\n\n   Readline Conditional Constructs\n       Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result of\n       tests.  There are four parser directives used.\n\n       $if    The  $if  construct allows bindings to be made based on the editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using readline.  The text of the test, after any comparison opera‐\n              tor,\n               extends to the end of the line; unless otherwise noted, no characters are required to isolate it.\n\n              mode   The mode= form of the $if directive is used to test whether readline is in emacs or vi mode.  This may be used in conjunction with the set keymap command, for instance,  to  set\n                     bindings in the emacs-standard and emacs-ctlx keymaps only if readline is starting out in emacs mode.\n\n              term   The  term=  form  may be used to include terminal-specific key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side of\n                     the = is tested against both the full name of the terminal and the portion of the terminal name before the first -.  This allows sun to match both sun and sun-cmd, for instance.\n\n              version\n                     The version test may be used to perform comparisons against specific readline versions.  The version expands to the current readline version.  The set  of  comparison  operators\n                     includes  =, (and ==), !=, =, .  The version number supplied on the right side of the operator consists of a major version number, an optional decimal point, and an\n                     optional minor version (e.g., 7.1). If the minor version is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.  The operator may be separated from the string version and from  the  version  number\n                     argument by whitespace.\n\n              application\n                     The  application  construct  is used to include application-specific settings.  Each program using the readline library sets the application name, and an initialization file can\n                     test for a particular value.  This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a key sequence  that\n                     quotes the current or previous word in bash:\n\n                     $if Bash\n                     # Quote the current or previous word\n                     \"\\C-xq\": \"\\eb\\\"\\ef\\\"\"\n                     $endif\n\n              variable\n                     The  variable construct provides simple equality tests for readline variables and values.  The permitted comparison operators are =, ==, and !=.  The variable name must be sepa‐\n                     rated from the comparison operator by whitespace; the operator may be separated from the value on the right hand side by whitespace.  Both string and boolean  variables  may  be\n                     tested. Boolean variables must be tested against the values on and off.\n\n       $endif This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an $if command.\n\n       $else  Commands in this branch of the $if directive are executed if the test fails.\n\n       $include\n              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands and bindings from that file.  For example, the following directive would read /etc/inputrc:\n\n              $include  /etc/inputrc\n\n   Searching\n       Readline provides commands for searching through the command history (see HISTORY below) for lines containing a specified string.  There are two search modes: incremental and non-incremental.\n\n       Incremental  searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string.  As each character of the search string is typed, readline displays the next entry from the history matching\n       the string typed so far.  An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry.  The characters present in the value of  the  isearch-terminators\n       variable are used to terminate an incremental search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value the Escape and Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search.  Control-G will\n       abort an incremental search and restore the original line.  When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the current line.\n\n       To find other matching entries in the history list, type Control-S or Control-R as appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in the history for the next  entry  matching  the  search\n       string  typed so far.  Any other key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the search and execute that command.  For instance, a newline will terminate the search and accept the\n       line, thereby executing the command from the history list.\n\n       Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two Control-Rs are typed without any intervening characters defining a new search string, any remembered search string is used.\n\n       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be typed by the user or be part of the contents of the cur‐\n       rent line.\n\n   Readline Command Names\n       The following is a list of the names of the commands and the default key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an accompanying key sequence are unbound by default.  In the\n       following descriptions, point refers to the current cursor position, and mark refers to a cursor position saved by the set-mark command.  The text between the point and mark is referred to as\n       the region.\n\n   Commands for Moving\n       beginning-of-line (C-a)\n              Move to the start of the current line.\n       end-of-line (C-e)\n              Move to the end of the line.\n       forward-char (C-f)\n              Move forward a character.\n       backward-char (C-b)\n              Move back a character.\n       forward-word (M-f)\n              Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).\n       backward-word (M-b)\n              Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are composed of alphanumeric characters (letters and digits).\n       shell-forward-word\n              Move forward to the end of the next word.  Words are delimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.\n       shell-backward-word\n              Move back to the start of the current or previous word.  Words are delimited by non-quoted shell metacharacters.\n       previous-screen-line\n              Attempt  to move point to the same physical screen column on the previous physical screen line. This will not have the desired effect if the current Readline line does not take up more\n              than one physical line or if point is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width.\n       next-screen-line\n              Attempt to move point to the same physical screen column on the next physical screen line. This will not have the desired effect if the current Readline line does not take up more than\n              one physical line or if the length of the current Readline line is not greater than the length of the prompt plus the screen width.\n       clear-screen (C-l)\n              Clear the screen leaving the current line at the top of the screen.  With an argument, refresh the current line without clearing the screen.\n       redraw-current-line\n              Refresh the current line.\n\n   Commands for Manipulating the History\n       accept-line (Newline, Return)\n              Accept the line regardless of where the cursor is.  If this line is non-empty, add it to the history list according to the state of the HISTCONTROL variable.  If the line is a modified\n              history line, then restore the history line to its original state.\n       previous-history (C-p)\n              Fetch the previous command from the history list, moving back in the list.\n       next-history (C-n)\n              Fetch the next command from the history list, moving forward in the list.\n       beginning-of-history (M-)\n              Move to the end of the input history, i.e., the line currently being entered.\n       reverse-search-history (C-r)\n              Search backward starting at the current line and moving `up' through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.\n       forward-search-history (C-s)\n              Search forward starting at the current line and moving `down' through the history as necessary.  This is an incremental search.\n       non-incremental-reverse-search-history (M-p)\n              Search backward through the history starting at the current line using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.\n       non-incremental-forward-search-history (M-n)\n              Search forward through the history using a non-incremental search for a string supplied by the user.\n       history-search-forward\n              Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  This is a non-incremental search.\n       history-search-backward\n              Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  This is a non-incremental search.\n       history-substring-search-backward\n              Search backward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the current cursor position (the point).  The search string  may  match  any‐\n              where in a history line.  This is a non-incremental search.\n       history-substring-search-forward\n              Search forward through the history for the string of characters between the start of the current line and the point.  The search string may match anywhere in a history line.  This is a\n              non-incremental search.\n       yank-nth-arg (M-C-y)\n              Insert the first argument to the previous command (usually the second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument n, insert the nth word from the previous command (the words\n              in  the previous command begin with word 0).  A negative argument inserts the nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once the argument n is computed, the argument is extracted\n              as if the \"!n\" history expansion had been specified.\n       yank-last-arg (M-., M-_)\n              Insert the last argument to the previous command (the last word of the previous history entry).  With a numeric  argument,  behave  exactly  like  yank-nth-arg.   Successive  calls  to\n              yank-last-arg move back through the history list, inserting the last word (or the word specified by the argument to the first call) of each line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied\n              to these successive calls determines the direction to move through the history.  A negative argument switches the direction through the history (back or forward).  The  history  expan‐\n              sion facilities are used to extract the last word, as if the \"!$\" history expansion had been specified.\n       shell-expand-line (M-C-e)\n              Expand the line as the shell does.  This performs alias and history expansion as well as all of the shell word expansions.  See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history ex‐\n              pansion.\n       history-expand-line (M-^)\n              Perform history expansion on the current line.  See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history expansion.\n       magic-space\n              Perform history expansion on the current line and insert a space.  See HISTORY EXPANSION below for a description of history expansion.\n       alias-expand-line\n              Perform alias expansion on the current line.  See ALIASES above for a description of alias expansion.\n       history-and-alias-expand-line\n              Perform history and alias expansion on the current line.\n       insert-last-argument (M-., M-_)\n              A synonym for yank-last-arg.\n       operate-and-get-next (C-o)\n              Accept the current line for execution and fetch the next line relative to the current line from the history for editing.  A numeric argument, if supplied, specifies the  history  entry\n              to use instead of the current line.\n       edit-and-execute-command (C-x C-e)\n              Invoke an editor on the current command line, and execute the result as shell commands.  Bash attempts to invoke $VISUAL, $EDITOR, and emacs as the editor, in that order.\n\n   Commands for Changing Text\n       end-of-file (usually C-d)\n              The  character  indicating end-of-file as set, for example, by ``stty''.  If this character is read when there are no characters on the line, and point is at the beginning of the line,\n              Readline interprets it as the end of input and returns EOF.\n       delete-char (C-d)\n              Delete the character at point.  If this function is bound to the same character as the tty EOF character, as C-d commonly is, see above for the effects.\n       backward-delete-char (Rubout)\n              Delete the character behind the cursor.  When given a numeric argument, save the deleted text on the kill ring.\n       forward-backward-delete-char\n              Delete the character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at the end of the line, in which case the character behind the cursor is deleted.\n       quoted-insert (C-q, C-v)\n              Add the next character typed to the line verbatim.  This is how to insert characters like C-q, for example.\n       tab-insert (C-v TAB)\n              Insert a tab character.\n       self-insert (a, b, A, 1, !, ...)\n              Insert the character typed.\n       transpose-chars (C-t)\n              Drag the character before point forward over the character at point, moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end of the line, then this transposes the two  characters  before\n              point.  Negative arguments have no effect.\n       transpose-words (M-t)\n              Drag the word before point past the word after point, moving point over that word as well.  If point is at the end of the line, this transposes the last two words on the line.\n       upcase-word (M-u)\n              Uppercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.\n       downcase-word (M-l)\n              Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.\n       capitalize-word (M-c)\n              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative argument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.\n       overwrite-mode\n              Toggle  overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric argument, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command\n              affects only emacs mode; vi mode does overwrite differently.  Each call to readline() starts in insert mode.  In overwrite mode, characters bound to self-insert  replace  the  text  at\n              point rather than pushing the text to the right.  Characters bound to backward-delete-char replace the character before point with a space.  By default, this command is unbound.\n\n   Killing and Yanking\n       kill-line (C-k)\n              Kill the text from point to the end of the line.\n       backward-kill-line (C-x Rubout)\n              Kill backward to the beginning of the line.\n       unix-line-discard (C-u)\n              Kill backward from point to the beginning of the line.  The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.\n       kill-whole-line\n              Kill all characters on the current line, no matter where point is.\n       kill-word (M-d)\n              Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by forward-word.\n       backward-kill-word (M-Rubout)\n              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by backward-word.\n       shell-kill-word\n              Kill from point to the end of the current word, or if between words, to the end of the next word.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by shell-forward-word.\n       shell-backward-kill-word\n              Kill the word behind point.  Word boundaries are the same as those used by shell-backward-word.\n       unix-word-rubout (C-w)\n              Kill the word behind point, using white space as a word boundary.  The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.\n       unix-filename-rubout\n              Kill the word behind point, using white space and the slash character as the word boundaries.  The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.\n       delete-horizontal-space (M-\\)\n              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.\n       kill-region\n              Kill the text in the current region.\n       copy-region-as-kill\n              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer.\n       copy-backward-word\n              Copy the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries are the same as backward-word.\n       copy-forward-word\n              Copy the word following point to the kill buffer.  The word boundaries are the same as forward-word.\n       yank (C-y)\n              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.\n       yank-pop (M-y)\n              Rotate the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works following yank or yank-pop.\n\n   Numeric Arguments\n       digit-argument (M-0, M-1, ..., M--)\n              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start a new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.\n       universal-argument\n              This  is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading minus sign, those digits define the argument.  If the command\n              is followed by digits, executing universal-argument again ends the numeric argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if this command is immediately followed by a  charac‐\n              ter  that  is  neither a digit nor minus sign, the argument count for the next command is multiplied by four.  The argument count is initially one, so executing this function the first\n              time makes the argument count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen, and so on.\n\n   Completing\n       complete (TAB)\n              Attempt to perform completion on the text before point.  Bash attempts completion treating the text as a variable (if the text begins with $), username (if the  text  begins  with  ~),\n              hostname (if the text begins with @), or command (including aliases and functions) in turn.  If none of these produces a match, filename completion is attempted.\n       possible-completions (M-?)\n              List the possible completions of the text before point.\n       insert-completions (M-*)\n              Insert all completions of the text before point that would have been generated by possible-completions.\n       menu-complete\n              Similar  to  complete,  but  replaces the word to be completed with a single match from the list of possible completions.  Repeated execution of menu-complete steps through the list of\n              possible completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of bell-style) and the original text  is  restored.\n              An  argument of n moves n positions forward in the list of matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward through the list.  This command is intended to be bound to TAB, but\n              is unbound by default.\n       menu-complete-backward\n              Identical to menu-complete, but moves backward through the list of possible completions, as if menu-complete had been given a negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.\n       delete-char-or-list\n              Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or end of the line (like delete-char).  If at the end of the line, behaves  identically  to  possible-completions.   This\n              command is unbound by default.\n       complete-filename (M-/)\n              Attempt filename completion on the text before point.\n       possible-filename-completions (C-x /)\n              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a filename.\n       complete-username (M-~)\n              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a username.\n       possible-username-completions (C-x ~)\n              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a username.\n       complete-variable (M-$)\n              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.\n       possible-variable-completions (C-x $)\n              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a shell variable.\n       complete-hostname (M-@)\n              Attempt completion on the text before point, treating it as a hostname.\n       possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)\n              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a hostname.\n       complete-command (M-!)\n              Attempt  completion  on  the  text  before  point, treating it as a command name.  Command completion attempts to match the text against aliases, reserved words, shell functions, shell\n              builtins, and finally executable filenames, in that order.\n       possible-command-completions (C-x !)\n              List the possible completions of the text before point, treating it as a command name.\n       dynamic-complete-history (M-TAB)\n              Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches.\n       dabbrev-expand\n              Attempt menu completion on the text before point, comparing the text against lines from the history list for possible completion matches.\n       complete-into-braces (M-{)\n              Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible completions enclosed within braces so the list is available to the shell (see Brace Expansion above).\n\n   Keyboard Macros\n       start-kbd-macro (C-x ()\n              Begin saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro.\n       end-kbd-macro (C-x ))\n              Stop saving the characters typed into the current keyboard macro and store the definition.\n       call-last-kbd-macro (C-x e)\n              Re-execute the last keyboard macro defined, by making the characters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.\n       print-last-kbd-macro ()\n              Print the last keyboard macro defined in a format suitable for the inputrc file.\n\n   Miscellaneous\n       re-read-init-file (C-x C-r)\n              Read in the contents of the inputrc file, and incorporate any bindings or variable assignments found there.\n       abort (C-g)\n              Abort the current editing command and ring the terminal's bell (subject to the setting of bell-style).\n       do-lowercase-version (M-A, M-B, M-x, ...)\n              If the metafied character x is uppercase, run the command that is bound to the corresponding metafied lowercase character.  The behavior is undefined if x is already lowercase.\n       prefix-meta (ESC)\n              Metafy the next character typed.  ESC f is equivalent to Meta-f.\n       undo (C-_, C-x C-u)\n              Incremental undo, separately remembered for each line.\n       revert-line (M-r)\n              Undo all changes made to this line.  This is like executing the undo command enough times to return the line to its initial state.\n       tilde-expand (M-&)\n              Perform tilde expansion on the current word.\n       set-mark (C-@, M-)\n              Set the mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the mark is set to that position.\n       exchange-point-and-mark (C-x C-x)\n              Swap the point with the mark.  The current cursor position is set to the saved position, and the old cursor position is saved as the mark.\n       character-search (C-])\n              A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of that character.  A negative count searches for previous occurrences.\n       character-search-backward (M-C-])\n              A character is read and point is moved to the previous occurrence of that character.  A negative count searches for subsequent occurrences.\n       skip-csi-sequence\n              Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence such as those defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences begin with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI),  usually  ESC-[.\n              If this sequence is bound to \"\\[\", keys producing such sequences will have no effect unless explicitly bound to a readline command, instead of inserting stray characters into the edit‐\n              ing buffer.  This is unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[.\n       insert-comment (M-#)\n              Without a numeric argument, the value of the readline comment-begin variable is inserted at the beginning of the current line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts  as\n              a  toggle: if the characters at the beginning of the line do not match the value of comment-begin, the value is inserted, otherwise the characters in comment-begin are deleted from the\n              beginning of the line.  In either case, the line is accepted as if a newline had been typed.  The default value of comment-begin causes this command to make the current  line  a  shell\n              comment.  If a numeric argument causes the comment character to be removed, the line will be executed by the shell.\n       glob-complete-word (M-g)\n              The  word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, with an asterisk implicitly appended.  This pattern is used to generate a list of matching filenames for possible\n              completions.\n       glob-expand-word (C-x *)\n              The word before point is treated as a pattern for pathname expansion, and the list of matching filenames is inserted, replacing the word.  If a numeric argument is supplied, an  aster‐\n              isk is appended before pathname expansion.\n       glob-list-expansions (C-x g)\n              The  list  of  expansions  that  would have been generated by glob-expand-word is displayed, and the line is redrawn.  If a numeric argument is supplied, an asterisk is appended before\n              pathname expansion.\n       dump-functions\n              Print all of the functions and their key bindings to the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made  part  of\n              an inputrc file.\n       dump-variables\n              Print  all  of  the settable readline variables and their values to the readline output stream.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be\n              made part of an inputrc file.\n       dump-macros\n              Print all of the readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.  If a numeric argument is supplied, the output is formatted in such a way that it can be made  part\n              of an inputrc file.\n       display-shell-version (C-x C-v)\n              Display version information about the current instance of bash.\n\n   Programmable Completion\n       When  word  completion  is attempted for an argument to a command for which a completion specification (a compspec) has been defined using the complete builtin (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS be‐\n       low), the programmable completion facilities are invoked.\n\n       First, the command name is identified.  If the command word is the empty string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line), any compspec defined with the -E option  to  complete\n       is  used.  If a compspec has been defined for that command, the compspec is used to generate the list of possible completions for the word.  If the command word is a full pathname, a compspec\n       for the full pathname is searched for first.  If no compspec is found for the full pathname, an attempt is made to find a compspec for  the  portion  following  the  final  slash.   If  those\n       searches  do  not result in a compspec, any compspec defined with the -D option to complete is used as the default.  If there is no default compspec, bash attempts alias expansion on the com‐\n       mand word as a final resort, and attempts to find a compspec for the command word from any successful expansion.\n\n       Once a compspec has been found, it is used to generate the list of matching words.  If a compspec is not found, the default bash completion as described above under Completing is performed.\n\n       First, the actions specified by the compspec are used.  Only matches which are prefixed by the word being completed are returned.  When the -f or -d option is used for filename  or  directory\n       name completion, the shell variable FIGNORE is used to filter the matches.\n\n       Any  completions  specified  by  a pathname expansion pattern to the -G option are generated next.  The words generated by the pattern need not match the word being completed.  The GLOBIGNORE\n       shell variable is not used to filter the matches, but the FIGNORE variable is used.\n\n       Next, the string specified as the argument to the -W option is considered.  The string is first split using the characters in the IFS special variable as delimiters.  Shell  quoting  is  hon‐\n       ored.  Each word is then expanded using brace expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, as described above under EXPANSION.\n       The results are split using the rules described above under Word Splitting.  The results of the expansion are prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the  matching  words  become\n       the possible completions.\n\n       After  these  matches  have been generated, any shell function or command specified with the -F and -C options is invoked.  When the command or function is invoked, the COMP_LINE, COMP_POINT,\n       COMP_KEY, and COMP_TYPE variables are assigned values as described above under Shell Variables.  If a shell function is being invoked, the COMP_WORDS and COMP_CWORD variables  are  also  set.\n       When  the function or command is invoked, the first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments are being completed, the second argument ($2) is the word being completed, and the\n       third argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line.  No filtering of the generated completions against the word being completed is  performed;  the\n       function or command has complete freedom in generating the matches.\n\n       Any  function  specified  with -F is invoked first.  The function may use any of the shell facilities, including the compgen builtin described below, to generate the matches.  It must put the\n       possible completions in the COMPREPLY array variable, one per array element.\n\n       Next, any command specified with the -C option is invoked in an environment equivalent to command substitution.  It should print a list of completions, one per line, to the  standard  output.\n       Backslash may be used to escape a newline, if necessary.\n\n       After  all  of the possible completions are generated, any filter specified with the -X option is applied to the list.  The filter is a pattern as used for pathname expansion; a & in the pat‐\n       tern is replaced with the text of the word being completed.  A literal & may be escaped with a backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.  Any completion that matches  the\n       pattern will be removed from the list.  A leading ! negates the pattern; in this case any completion not matching the pattern will be removed.  If the nocasematch shell option is enabled, the\n       match is performed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.\n\n       Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the -P and -S options are added to each member of the completion list, and the result is returned to the readline completion code as the list  of\n       possible completions.\n\n       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and the -o dirnames option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted.\n\n       If the -o plusdirs option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.\n\n       By  default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code as the full set of possible completions.  The default bash completions are not attempted, and the\n       readline default of filename completion is disabled.  If the -o bashdefault option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, the bash default completions are  attempted  if  the\n       compspec  generates  no matches.  If the -o default option was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the compspec (and, if at‐\n       tempted, the default bash completions) generate no matches.\n\n       When a compspec indicates that directory name completion is desired, the programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash to completed names which are symbolic links to  di‐\n       rectories, subject to the value of the mark-directories readline variable, regardless of the setting of the mark-symlinked-directories readline variable.\n\n       There is some support for dynamically modifying completions.  This is most useful when used in combination with a default completion specified with complete -D.  It's possible for shell func‐\n       tions executed as completion handlers to indicate that completion should be retried by returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124, and changes the  compspec  associated\n       with the command on which completion is being attempted (supplied as the first argument when the function is executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an attempt to\n       find a new compspec for that command.  This allows a set of completions to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather than being loaded all at once.\n\n       For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command, the following default completion function would load completions dy‐\n       namically:\n\n       _completion_loader()\n       {\n            . \"/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124\n       }\n       complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default\n\nHISTORY\n       When  the -o history option to the set builtin is enabled, the shell provides access to the command history, the list of commands previously typed.  The value of the HISTSIZE variable is used\n       as the number of commands to save in a history list.  The text of the last HISTSIZE commands (default 500) is saved.  The shell stores each command in the history list prior to parameter  and\n       variable expansion (see EXPANSION above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the values of the shell variables HISTIGNORE and HISTCONTROL.\n\n       On  startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the variable HISTFILE (default ~/.bash_history).  The file named by the value of HISTFILE is truncated, if necessary, to contain\n       no more than the number of lines specified by the value of HISTFILESIZE.  If HISTFILESIZE is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value less than zero, the history file is\n       not truncated.  When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the following history line.\n       These timestamps are optionally displayed depending on the value of the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable.  When a shell with history enabled exits, the last $HISTSIZE lines are copied from the history\n       list to $HISTFILE.  If the histappend shell option is enabled (see the description of shopt under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below), the lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the his‐\n       tory file is overwritten.  If HISTFILE is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.  If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, time stamps are written to the history\n       file,  marked  with the history comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines.\n       After saving the history, the history file is truncated to contain no more than HISTFILESIZE lines.  If HISTFILESIZE is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or  a  numeric  value  less\n       than zero, the history file is not truncated.\n\n       The  builtin  command fc (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) may be used to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list.  The history builtin may be used to display or modify the\n       history list and manipulate the history file.  When using command-line editing, search commands are available in each editing mode that provide access to the history list.\n\n       The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history list.  The HISTCONTROL and HISTIGNORE variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset of the  commands  en‐\n       tered.   The  cmdhist  shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding semicolons where necessary to preserve\n       syntactic correctness.  The lithist shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead of semicolons.  See the description of the shopt builtin below under SHELL\n       BUILTIN COMMANDS for information on setting and unsetting shell options.\n\nHISTORY EXPANSION\n       The shell supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the history expansion in csh.  This section describes what syntax features are available.  This feature is enabled by default\n       for interactive shells, and can be disabled using the +H option to the set builtin command (see SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below).  Non-interactive shells do not perform history expansion by  de‐\n       fault.\n\n       History  expansions  introduce words from the history list into the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or\n       fix errors in previous commands quickly.\n\n       History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed on each line individually without taking quoting on  previous\n       lines  into  account.   It takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during substitution.  The second is to select portions of that line for\n       inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the history is the event, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are words.  Various modifiers are available  to  manipulate\n       the selected words.  The line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several metacharacter-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  His‐\n       tory expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history expansion character, which is ! by default.  Only backslash (\\) and single quotes can quote the  history  expansion  character,\n       but the history expansion character is also treated as quoted if it immediately precedes the closing double quote in a double-quoted string.\n\n       Several  characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately following the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space, tab, newline, carriage return, and =.  If the ext‐\n       glob shell option is enabled, ( will also inhibit expansion.\n\n       Several shell options settable with the shopt builtin may be used to tailor the behavior of history expansion.  If the histverify shell option is enabled (see the  description  of  the  shopt\n       builtin  below), and readline is being used, history substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the expanded line is reloaded into the readline editing buffer for\n       further modification.  If readline is being used, and the histreedit shell option is enabled, a failed history substitution will be reloaded into the readline editing buffer  for  correction.\n       The  -p option to the history builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will do before using it.  The -s option to the history builtin may be used to add commands to the end\n       of the history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for subsequent recall.\n\n       The shell allows control of the various characters used by the history expansion mechanism (see the description of histchars above under Shell Variables).  The shell uses the history  comment\n       character to mark history timestamps when writing the history file.\n\n   Event Designators\n       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the history list.  Unless the reference is absolute, events are relative to the current position in the history list.\n\n       !      Start a history substitution, except when followed by a blank, newline, carriage return, = or ( (when the extglob shell option is enabled using the shopt builtin).\n       !n     Refer to command line n.\n       !-n    Refer to the current command minus n.\n       !!     Refer to the previous command.  This is a synonym for `!-1'.\n       !string\n              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list starting with string.\n       !?string[?]\n              Refer to the most recent command preceding the current position in the history list containing string.  The trailing ? may be omitted if string is followed immediately by a newline.\n       ^string1^string2^\n              Quick substitution.  Repeat the previous command, replacing string1 with string2.  Equivalent to ``!!:s/string1/string2/'' (see Modifiers below).\n       !#     The entire command line typed so far.\n\n   Word Designators\n       Word  designators  are used to select desired words from the event.  A : separates the event specification from the word designator.  It may be omitted if the word designator begins with a ^,\n       $, *, -, or %.  Words are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.\n\n       0 (zero)\n              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.\n       n      The nth word.\n       ^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.\n       $      The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will expand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.\n       %      The word matched by the most recent `?string?' search.\n       x-y    A range of words; `-y' abbreviates `0-y'.\n       *      All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `1-$'.  It is not an error to use * if there is just one word in the event; the empty string is returned in that case.\n       x*     Abbreviates x-$.\n       x-     Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.\n\n       If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the previous command is used as the event.\n\n   Modifiers\n       After the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.\n\n       h      Remove a trailing filename component, leaving only the head.\n       t      Remove all leading filename components, leaving the tail.\n       r      Remove a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leaving the basename.\n       e      Remove all but the trailing suffix.\n       p      Print the new command but do not execute it.\n       q      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.\n       x      Quote the substituted words as with q, but break into words at blanks and newlines.\n       s/old/new/\n              Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in the event line.  Any delimiter can be used in place of /.  The final delimiter is optional if it is the last character  of  the  event\n              line.  The delimiter may be quoted in old and new with a single backslash.  If & appears in new, it is replaced by old.  A single backslash will quote the &.  If old is null, it is set\n              to the last old substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place, the last string in a !?string[?]  search.\n       &      Repeat the previous substitution.\n       g      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is used in conjunction with `:s' (e.g., `:gs/old/new/') or `:&'.  If used with `:s', any delimiter can be used in place of\n              /, and the final delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line.  An a may be used as a synonym for g.\n       G      Apply the following `s' modifier once to each word in the event line.\n\nSHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS\n       Unless  otherwise  noted,  each  builtin  command  documented  in this section as accepting options preceded by - accepts -- to signify the end of the options.  The :, true, false, and test/[\n       builtins do not accept options and do not treat -- specially.  The exit, logout, return, break, continue, let, and shift builtins accept and process arguments beginning with - without requir‐\n       ing --.  Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments beginning with - as invalid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.\n       : [arguments]\n              No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments and performing any specified redirections.  The return status is zero.\n\n        .  filename [arguments]\n       source filename [arguments]\n              Read  and  execute commands from filename in the current shell environment and return the exit status of the last command executed from filename.  If filename does not contain a slash,\n              filenames in PATH are used to find the directory containing filename.  The file searched for in PATH need not be executable.  When bash is not in posix mode, the current  directory  is\n              searched  if  no  file is found in PATH.  If the sourcepath option to the shopt builtin command is turned off, the PATH is not searched.  If any arguments are supplied, they become the\n              positional parameters when filename is executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.  If the -T option is enabled, source inherits any trap on DEBUG; if it is not,  any\n              DEBUG  trap  string is saved and restored around the call to source, and source unsets the DEBUG trap while it executes.  If -T is not set, and the sourced file changes the DEBUG trap,\n              the new value is retained when source completes.  The return status is the status of the last command exited within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if filename is\n              not found or cannot be read.\n\n       alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]\n              Alias  with  no  arguments  or with the -p option prints the list of aliases in the form alias name=value on standard output.  When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each\n              name whose value is given.  A trailing space in value causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.  For each name  in  the  argument  list  for\n              which no value is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.  Alias returns true unless a name is given for which no alias has been defined.\n\n       bg [jobspec ...]\n              Resume  each suspended job jobspec in the background, as if it had been started with &.  If jobspec is not present, the shell's notion of the current job is used.  bg jobspec returns 0\n              unless run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, any specified jobspec was not found or was started without job control.\n\n       bind [-m keymap] [-lpsvPSVX]\n       bind [-m keymap] [-q function] [-u function] [-r keyseq]\n       bind [-m keymap] -f filename\n       bind [-m keymap] -x keyseq:shell-command\n       bind [-m keymap] keyseq:function-name\n       bind [-m keymap] keyseq:readline-command\n              Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline function or macro, or set a readline variable.  Each non-option argument is a command as it  would\n              appear in .inputrc, but each binding or command must be passed as a separate argument; e.g., '\"\\C-x\\C-r\": re-read-init-file'.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:\n              -m keymap\n                     Use  keymap  as  the  keymap  to be affected by the subsequent bindings.  Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and\n                     vi-insert.  vi is equivalent to vi-command (vi-move is also a synonym); emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.\n              -l     List the names of all readline functions.\n              -p     Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.\n              -P     List current readline function names and bindings.\n              -s     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such a way that they can be re-read.\n              -S     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.\n              -v     Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.\n              -V     List current readline variable names and values.\n              -f filename\n                     Read key bindings from filename.\n              -q function\n                     Query about which keys invoke the named function.\n              -u function\n                     Unbind all keys bound to the named function.\n              -r keyseq\n                     Remove any current binding for keyseq.\n              -x keyseq:shell-command\n                     Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.  When shell-command is executed, the shell sets the READLINE_LINE variable to the contents of  the  readline  line\n                     buffer  and  the READLINE_POINT variable to the current location of the insertion point.  If the executed command changes the value of READLINE_LINE or READLINE_POINT, those new\n                     values will be reflected in the editing state.\n              -X     List all key sequences bound to shell commands and the associated commands in a format that can be reused as input.\n\n              The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.\n\n       break [n]\n              Exit from within a for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, break n levels.  n must be ≥ 1.  If n is greater than the number of enclosing loops, all enclosing  loops  are\n              exited.  The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.\n\n       builtin shell-builtin [arguments]\n              Execute the specified shell builtin, passing it arguments, and return its exit status.  This is useful when defining a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the\n              functionality of the builtin within the function.  The cd builtin is commonly redefined this way.  The return status is false if shell-builtin is not a shell builtin command.\n\n       caller [expr]\n              Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a script executed with the . or source builtins).  Without expr, caller displays the line number and source file‐\n              name of the current subroutine call.  If a non-negative integer is supplied as expr, caller displays the line number, subroutine name, and source file corresponding to that position in\n              the current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used, for example, to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.  The return value is 0 unless  the  shell  is\n              not executing a subroutine call or expr does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.\n\n       cd [-L|[-P [-e]] [-@]] [dir]\n              Change  the  current  directory to dir.  if dir is not supplied, the value of the HOME shell variable is the default.  Any additional arguments following dir are ignored.  The variable\n              CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing dir: each directory name in CDPATH is searched for dir.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:).\n              A  null directory name in CDPATH is the same as the current directory, i.e., ``.''.  If dir begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used.  The -P option causes cd to use the physi‐\n              cal directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing dir and before processing instances of .. in dir (see also the -P option to the set builtin command); the -L option\n              forces symbolic links to be followed by resolving the link after processing instances of .. in dir.  If .. appears in dir, it is processed by removing the immediately previous pathname\n              component from dir, back to a slash or the beginning of dir.  If the -e option is supplied with -P, and the current working directory cannot be successfully determined after a success‐\n              ful  directory change, cd will return an unsuccessful status.  On systems that support it, the -@ option presents the extended attributes associated with a file as a directory.  An ar‐\n              gument of - is converted to $OLDPWD before the directory change is attempted.  If a non-empty directory name from CDPATH is used, or if - is  the  first  argument,  and  the  directory\n              change  is  successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is written to the standard output.  The return value is true if the directory was successfully changed; false\n              otherwise.\n\n       command [-pVv] command [arg ...]\n              Run command with args suppressing the normal shell function lookup.  Only builtin commands or commands found in the PATH are executed.  If the -p option is given, the search  for  com‐\n              mand  is  performed  using  a  default  value for PATH that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.  If either the -V or -v option is supplied, a description of command is\n              printed.  The -v option causes a single word indicating the command or filename used to invoke command to be displayed; the -V option produces a more verbose description.  If the -V or\n              -v option is supplied, the exit status is 0 if command was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or command cannot be found, the exit status is 127.\n              Otherwise, the exit status of the command builtin is the exit status of command.\n\n       compgen [option] [word]\n              Generate possible completion matches for word according to the options, which may be any option accepted by the complete builtin with the exception of -p and -r, and write the  matches\n              to the standard output.  When using the -F or -C options, the various shell variables set by the programmable completion facilities, while available, will not have useful values.\n\n              The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had generated them directly from a completion specification with the same flags.  If word is speci‐\n              fied, only those completions matching word will be displayed.\n\n              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated.\n\n       complete [-abcdefgjksuv] [-o comp-option] [-DEI] [-A action] [-G globpat] [-W wordlist] [-F function] [-C command]\n              [-X filterpat] [-P prefix] [-S suffix] name [name ...]\n       complete -pr [-DEI] [name ...]\n              Specify how arguments to each name should be completed.  If the -p option is supplied, or if no options are supplied, existing completion specifications are printed in a way  that  al‐\n              lows  them to be reused as input.  The -r option removes a completion specification for each name, or, if no names are supplied, all completion specifications.  The -D option indicates\n              that other supplied options and actions should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for which no completion has previously  been  de‐\n              fined.   The -E option indicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The -I option in‐\n              dicates that other supplied options and actions should apply to completion on the inital non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as ; or |, which is  usually\n              command  name  completion.  If multiple options are supplied, the -D option takes precedence over -E, and both take precedence over -I.  If any of -D, -E, or -I are supplied, any other\n              name arguments are ignored; these completions only apply to the case specified by the option.\n\n              The process of applying these completion specifications when word completion is attempted is described above under Programmable Completion.\n\n              Other options, if specified, have the following meanings.  The arguments to the -G, -W, and -X options (and, if necessary, the -P and -S options) should be quoted to protect them  from\n              expansion before the complete builtin is invoked.\n              -o comp-option\n                      The comp-option controls several aspects of the compspec's behavior beyond the simple generation of completions.  comp-option may be one of:\n                      bashdefault\n                              Perform the rest of the default bash completions if the compspec generates no matches.\n                      default Use readline's default filename completion if the compspec generates no matches.\n                      dirnames\n                              Perform directory name completion if the compspec generates no matches.\n                      filenames\n                              Tell readline that the compspec generates filenames, so it can perform any filename-specific processing (like adding a slash to directory names, quoting special charac‐\n                              ters, or suppressing trailing spaces).  Intended to be used with shell functions.\n                      noquote Tell readline not to quote the completed words if they are filenames (quoting filenames is the default).\n                      nosort  Tell readline not to sort the list of possible completions alphabetically.\n                      nospace Tell readline not to append a space (the default) to words completed at the end of the line.\n                      plusdirs\n                              After any matches defined by the compspec are generated, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are added to the results of the other actions.\n              -A action\n                      The action may be one of the following to generate a list of possible completions:\n                      alias   Alias names.  May also be specified as -a.\n                      arrayvar\n                              Array variable names.\n                      binding Readline key binding names.\n                      builtin Names of shell builtin commands.  May also be specified as -b.\n                      command Command names.  May also be specified as -c.\n                      directory\n                              Directory names.  May also be specified as -d.\n                      disabled\n                              Names of disabled shell builtins.\n                      enabled Names of enabled shell builtins.\n                      export  Names of exported shell variables.  May also be specified as -e.\n                      file    File names.  May also be specified as -f.\n                      function\n                              Names of shell functions.\n                      group   Group names.  May also be specified as -g.\n                      helptopic\n                              Help topics as accepted by the help builtin.\n                      hostname\n                              Hostnames, as taken from the file specified by the HOSTFILE shell variable.\n                      job     Job names, if job control is active.  May also be specified as -j.\n                      keyword Shell reserved words.  May also be specified as -k.\n                      running Names of running jobs, if job control is active.\n                      service Service names.  May also be specified as -s.\n                      setopt  Valid arguments for the -o option to the set builtin.\n                      shopt   Shell option names as accepted by the shopt builtin.\n                      signal  Signal names.\n                      stopped Names of stopped jobs, if job control is active.\n                      user    User names.  May also be specified as -u.\n                      variable\n                              Names of all shell variables.  May also be specified as -v.\n              -C command\n                      command is executed in a subshell environment, and its output is used as the possible completions.\n              -F function\n                      The shell function function is executed in the current shell environment.  When the function is executed, the first argument ($1) is the name of the command whose arguments are\n                      being  completed,  the second argument ($2) is the word being completed, and the third argument ($3) is the word preceding the word being completed on the current command line.\n                      When it finishes, the possible completions are retrieved from the value of the COMPREPLY array variable.\n              -G globpat\n                      The pathname expansion pattern globpat is expanded to generate the possible completions.\n              -P prefix\n                      prefix is added at the beginning of each possible completion after all other options have been applied.\n              -S suffix\n                      suffix is appended to each possible completion after all other options have been applied.\n              -W wordlist\n                      The wordlist is split using the characters in the IFS special variable as delimiters, and each resultant word is expanded.  Shell quoting is honored within wordlist,  in  order\n                      to  provide  a  mechanism for the words to contain shell metacharacters or characters in the value of IFS.  The possible completions are the members of the resultant list which\n                      match the word being completed.\n              -X filterpat\n                      filterpat is a pattern as used for pathname expansion.  It is applied to the list of possible completions generated by the preceding options and arguments, and each  completion\n                      matching filterpat is removed from the list.  A leading ! in filterpat negates the pattern; in this case, any completion not matching filterpat is removed.\n\n              The  return  value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an option other than -p or -r is supplied without a name argument, an attempt is made to remove a completion specifica‐\n              tion for a name for which no specification exists, or an error occurs adding a completion specification.\n\n       compopt [-o option] [-DEI] [+o option] [name]\n              Modify completion options for each name according to the options, or for the currently-executing completion if no names are supplied.  If no options are given, display  the  completion\n              options  for  each name or the current completion.  The possible values of option are those valid for the complete builtin described above.  The -D option indicates that other supplied\n              options should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for which no completion has previously been defined.   The  -E  option  indicates\n              that other supplied options should apply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.  The -I option indicates that other supplied options should ap‐\n              ply to completion on the inital non-assignment word on the line, or after a command delimiter such as ; or |, which is usually command name completion.\n\n              The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify the options for a name for which no completion specification exists, or an output error  oc‐\n              curs.\n\n       continue [n]\n              Resume  the next iteration of the enclosing for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, resume at the nth enclosing loop.  n must be ≥ 1.  If n is greater than the number of\n              enclosing loops, the last enclosing loop (the ``top-level'' loop) is resumed.  The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.\n\n       declare [-aAfFgilnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]\n       typeset [-aAfFgilnrtux] [-p] [name[=value] ...]\n              Declare variables and/or give them attributes.  If no names are given then display the values of variables.  The -p option will display the attributes and values of each name.  When -p\n              is  used with name arguments, additional options, other than -f and -F, are ignored.  When -p is supplied without name arguments, it will display the attributes and values of all vari‐\n              ables having the attributes specified by the additional options.  If no other options are supplied with -p, declare will display the attributes and values of all shell variables.   The\n              -f option will restrict the display to shell functions.  The -F option inhibits the display of function definitions; only the function name and attributes are printed.  If the extdebug\n              shell option is enabled using shopt, the source file name and line number where each name is defined are displayed as well.  The -F option implies -f.  The -g option  forces  variables\n              to be created or modified at the global scope, even when declare is executed in a shell function.  It is ignored in all other cases.  The following options can be used to restrict out‐\n              put to variables with the specified attribute or to give variables attributes:\n              -a     Each name is an indexed array variable (see Arrays above).\n              -A     Each name is an associative array variable (see Arrays above).\n              -f     Use function names only.\n              -i     The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evaluation (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above) is performed when the variable is assigned a value.\n              -l     When the variable is assigned a value, all upper-case characters are converted to lower-case.  The upper-case attribute is disabled.\n              -n     Give each name the nameref attribute, making it a name reference to another variable.  That other variable is defined by the value of name.  All references, assignments, and at‐\n                     tribute modifications to name, except those using or changing the -n attribute itself, are performed on the variable referenced by name's value.  The nameref attribute cannot be\n                     applied to array variables.\n              -r     Make names readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned values by subsequent assignment statements or unset.\n              -t     Give each name the trace attribute.  Traced functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps from the calling shell.  The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.\n              -u     When the variable is assigned a value, all lower-case characters are converted to upper-case.  The lower-case attribute is disabled.\n              -x     Mark names for export to subsequent commands via the environment.\n\n              Using `+' instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead, with the exceptions that +a and +A may not be used to destroy array variables and +r will not remove the  readonly  attribute.\n              When  used in a function, declare and typeset make each name local, as with the local command, unless the -g option is supplied.  If a variable name is followed by =value, the value of\n              the variable is set to value.  When using -a or -A and the compound assignment syntax to create array variables, additional attributes do not take effect until subsequent  assignments.\n              The  return  value  is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is made to define a function using ``-f foo=bar'', an attempt is made to assign a value to a readonly vari‐\n              able, an attempt is made to assign a value to an array variable without using the compound assignment syntax (see Arrays above), one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, an\n              attempt  is made to turn off readonly status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to turn off array status for an array variable, or an attempt is made to display a non-existent\n              function with -f.\n\n       dirs [-clpv] [+n] [-n]\n              Without options, displays the list of currently remembered directories.  The default display is on a single line with directory names separated by spaces.  Directories are added to the\n              list with the pushd command; the popd command removes entries from the list.  The current directory is always the first directory in the stack.\n              -c     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.\n              -l     Produces a listing using full pathnames; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.\n              -p     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.\n              -v     Print the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.\n              +n     Displays the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with zero.\n              -n     Displays the nth entry counting from the right of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options, starting with zero.\n\n              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or n indexes beyond the end of the directory stack.\n\n       disown [-ar] [-h] [jobspec ... | pid ... ]\n              Without  options,  remove  each jobspec from the table of active jobs.  If jobspec is not present, and neither the -a nor the -r option is supplied, the current job is used.  If the -h\n              option is given, each jobspec is not removed from the table, but is marked so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the shell receives a SIGHUP.  If no jobspec is supplied, the -a  op‐\n              tion  means  to  remove or mark all jobs; the -r option without a jobspec argument restricts operation to running jobs.  The return value is 0 unless a jobspec does not specify a valid\n              job.\n\n       echo [-neE] [arg ...]\n              Output the args, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.  The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs.  If -n is specified, the trailing newline is suppressed.   If  the  -e\n              option  is  given, interpretation of the following backslash-escaped characters is enabled.  The -E option disables the interpretation of these escape characters, even on systems where\n              they are interpreted by default.  The xpg_echo shell option may be used to dynamically determine whether or not echo expands these escape characters by default.  echo does  not  inter‐\n              pret -- to mean the end of options.  echo interprets the following escape sequences:\n              \\a     alert (bell)\n              \\b     backspace\n              \\c     suppress further output\n              \\e\n              \\E     an escape character\n              \\f     form feed\n              \\n     new line\n              \\r     carriage return\n              \\t     horizontal tab\n              \\v     vertical tab\n              \\\\     backslash\n              \\0nnn  the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (zero to three octal digits)\n              \\xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)\n              \\uHHHH the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHH (one to four hex digits)\n              \\UHHHHHHHH\n                     the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the hexadecimal value HHHHHHHH (one to eight hex digits)\n\n       enable [-a] [-dnps] [-f filename] [name ...]\n              Enable and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin allows a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin to be executed without specifying a full pathname, even\n              though the shell normally searches for builtins before disk commands.  If -n is used, each name is disabled; otherwise, names are enabled.  For example, to use the  test  binary  found\n              via  the  PATH instead of the shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.  The -f option means to load the new builtin command name from shared object filename, on systems that sup‐\n              port dynamic loading.  The -d option will delete a builtin previously loaded with -f.  If no name arguments are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a  list  of  shell  builtins  is\n              printed.   With no other option arguments, the list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If -n is supplied, only disabled builtins are printed.  If -a is supplied, the list printed\n              includes all builtins, with an indication of whether or not each is enabled.  If -s is supplied, the output is restricted to the POSIX special builtins.  The return value is 0 unless a\n              name is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading a new builtin from a shared object.\n\n       eval [arg ...]\n              The args are read and concatenated together into a single command.  This command is then read and executed by the shell, and its exit status is returned as the value of eval.  If there\n              are no args, or only null arguments, eval returns 0.\n\n       exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]\n              If command is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The arguments become the arguments to command.  If the -l option is supplied, the shell places  a  dash  at\n              the  beginning  of  the  zeroth argument passed to command.  This is what login(1) does.  The -c option causes command to be executed with an empty environment.  If -a is supplied, the\n              shell passes name as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If command cannot be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless the execfail shell option is en‐\n              abled.   In  that  case,  it  returns failure.  An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.  A subshell exits unconditionally if exec fails.  If command is not\n              specified, any redirections take effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.\n\n       exit [n]\n              Cause the shell to exit with a status of n.  If n is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed.  A trap on EXIT is executed before the shell terminates.\n\n       export [-fn] [name[=word]] ...\n       export -p\n              The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If the -f option is given, the names refer to  functions.   If  no  names  are\n              given,  or  if  the  -p option is supplied, a list of names of all exported variables is printed.  The -n option causes the export property to be removed from each name.  If a variable\n              name is followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to word.  export returns an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid  shell\n              variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.\n\n       fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last]\n       fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]\n              The  first form selects a range of commands from first to last from the history list and displays or edits and re-executes them.  First and last may be specified as a string (to locate\n              the last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the current command number).  If last  is\n              not  specified,  it  is  set to the current command for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to first otherwise.  If first is not specified, it is set to the\n              previous command for editing and -16 for listing.\n\n              The -n option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The -r option reverses the order of the commands.  If the -l option is given, the commands are listed  on  standard  output.\n              Otherwise, the editor given by ename is invoked on a file containing those commands.  If ename is not given, the value of the FCEDIT variable is used, and the value of EDITOR if FCEDIT\n              is not set.  If neither variable is set, vi is used.  When editing is complete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.\n\n              In the second form, command is re-executed after each instance of pat is replaced by rep.  Command is interpreted the same as first above.  A useful alias to use with this  is  ``r=\"fc\n              -s\"'', so that typing ``r cc'' runs the last command beginning with ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.\n\n              If  the first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or first or last specify history lines out of range.  If the -e option is supplied, the return\n              value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second form is used, the return status is that of the command\n              re-executed, unless cmd does not specify a valid history line, in which case fc returns failure.\n\n       fg [jobspec]\n              Resume  jobspec  in  the  foreground,  and  make it the current job.  If jobspec is not present, the shell's notion of the current job is used.  The return value is that of the command\n              placed into the foreground, or failure if run when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if jobspec does not specify a valid job or  jobspec  specifies  a  job\n              that was started without job control.\n\n       getopts optstring name [args]\n              getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters.  optstring contains the option characters to be recognized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is ex‐\n              pected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not be used as option characters.  Each time  it  is  invoked,\n              getopts  places the next option in the shell variable name, initializing name if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the variable OPTIND.  OPTIND\n              is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an option requires an argument, getopts places that argument into the variable OPTARG.  The shell  does  not\n              reset OPTIND automatically; it must be manually reset between multiple calls to getopts within the same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.\n\n              When the end of options is encountered, getopts exits with a return value greater than zero.  OPTIND is set to the index of the first non-option argument, and name is set to ?.\n\n              getopts normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are given in args, getopts parses those instead.\n\n              getopts  can  report errors in two ways.  If the first character of optstring is a colon, silent error reporting is used.  In normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed when in‐\n              valid options or missing option arguments are encountered.  If the variable OPTERR is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first character of optstring is  not  a\n              colon.\n\n              If  an  invalid option is seen, getopts places ? into name and, if not silent, prints an error message and unsets OPTARG.  If getopts is silent, the option character found is placed in\n              OPTARG and no diagnostic message is printed.\n\n              If a required argument is not found, and getopts is not silent, a question mark (?) is placed in name, OPTARG is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed.  If getopts is silent, then\n              a colon (:) is placed in name and OPTARG is set to the option character found.\n\n              getopts returns true if an option, specified or unspecified, is found.  It returns false if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.\n\n       hash [-lr] [-p filename] [-dt] [name]\n              Each  time  hash is invoked, the full pathname of the command name is determined by searching the directories in $PATH and remembered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded.\n              If the -p option is supplied, no path search is performed, and filename is used as the full filename of the command.  The -r option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.\n              The  -d option causes the shell to forget the remembered location of each name.  If the -t option is supplied, the full pathname to which each name corresponds is printed.  If multiple\n              name arguments are supplied with -t, the name is printed before the hashed full pathname.  The -l option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.   If  no\n              arguments  are  given,  or  if only -l is supplied, information about remembered commands is printed.  The return status is true unless a name is not found or an invalid option is sup‐\n              plied.\n\n       help [-dms] [pattern]\n              Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If pattern is specified, help gives detailed help on all commands matching pattern; otherwise help for all the builtins  and  shell\n              control structures is printed.\n              -d     Display a short description of each pattern\n              -m     Display the description of each pattern in a manpage-like format\n              -s     Display only a short usage synopsis for each pattern\n\n              The return status is 0 unless no command matches pattern.\n\n       history [n]\n       history -c\n       history -d offset\n       history -d start-end\n       history -anrw [filename]\n       history -p arg [arg ...]\n       history -s arg [arg ...]\n              With  no  options,  display the command history list with line numbers.  Lines listed with a * have been modified.  An argument of n lists only the last n lines.  If the shell variable\n              HISTTIMEFORMAT is set and not null, it is used as a format string for strftime(3) to display the time stamp associated with each displayed  history  entry.   No  intervening  blank  is\n              printed between the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If filename is supplied, it is used as the name of the history file; if not, the value of HISTFILE is used.  Options, if\n              supplied, have the following meanings:\n              -c     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.\n              -d offset\n                     Delete the history entry at position offset.  If offset is negative, it is interpreted as relative to one greater than the last history position, so negative indices count  back\n                     from the end of the history, and an index of -1 refers to the current history -d command.\n              -d start-end\n                     Delete the history entries between positions start and end, inclusive.  Positive and negative values for start and end are interpreted as described above.\n              -a     Append  the  ``new'' history lines to the history file.  These are history lines entered since the beginning of the current bash session, but not already appended to the history\n                     file.\n              -n     Read the history lines not already read from the history file into the current history list.  These are lines appended to the history file since the  beginning  of  the  current\n                     bash session.\n              -r     Read the contents of the history file and append them to the current history list.\n              -w     Write the current history list to the history file, overwriting the history file's contents.\n              -p     Perform  history  substitution  on the following args and display the result on the standard output.  Does not store the results in the history list.  Each arg must be quoted to\n                     disable normal history expansion.\n              -s     Store the args in the history list as a single entry.  The last command in the history list is removed before the args are added.\n\n              If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set, the time stamp information associated with each history entry is written to the history file, marked with the history  comment  character.   When\n              the  history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the following history entry.  The return\n              value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while reading or writing the history file, an invalid offset is supplied as an argument to -d, or the history expan‐\n              sion supplied as an argument to -p fails.\n\n       jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]\n       jobs -x command [ args ... ]\n              The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following meanings:\n              -l     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.\n              -n     Display information only about jobs that have changed status since the user was last notified of their status.\n              -p     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.\n              -r     Display only running jobs.\n              -s     Display only stopped jobs.\n\n              If jobspec is given, output is restricted to information about that job.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or an invalid jobspec is supplied.\n\n              If  the -x option is supplied, jobs replaces any jobspec found in command or args with the corresponding process group ID, and executes command passing it args, returning its exit sta‐\n              tus.\n\n       kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] [pid | jobspec] ...\n       kill -l|-L [sigspec | exit_status]\n              Send the signal named by sigspec or signum to the processes named by pid or jobspec.  sigspec is either a case-insensitive signal name such as SIGKILL (with or without the SIG  prefix)\n              or a signal number; signum is a signal number.  If sigspec is not present, then SIGTERM is assumed.  An argument of -l lists the signal names.  If any arguments are supplied when -l is\n              given, the names of the signals corresponding to the arguments are listed, and the return status is 0.  The exit_status argument to -l is a number specifying either a signal number  or\n              the exit status of a process terminated by a signal.  The -L option is equivalent to -l.  kill returns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or\n              an invalid option is encountered.\n\n       let arg [arg ...]\n              Each arg is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see ARITHMETIC EVALUATION above).  If the last arg evaluates to 0, let returns 1; 0 is returned otherwise.\n\n       local [option] [name[=value] ... | - ]\n              For each argument, a local variable named name is created, and assigned value.  The option can be any of the options accepted by declare.  When local is  used  within  a  function,  it\n              causes  the  variable name to have a visible scope restricted to that function and its children.  If name is -, the set of shell options is made local to the function in which local is\n              invoked: shell options changed using the set builtin inside the function are restored to their original values when the function returns.  With no operands, local writes a list of  lo‐\n              cal  variables to the standard output.  It is an error to use local when not within a function.  The return status is 0 unless local is used outside a function, an invalid name is sup‐\n              plied, or name is a readonly variable.\n\n       logout Exit a login shell.\n\n       mapfile [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]\n       readarray [-d delim] [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]\n              Read lines from the standard input into the indexed array variable array, or from file descriptor fd if the -u option is supplied.  The variable MAPFILE is the default array.  Options,\n              if supplied, have the following meanings:\n              -d     The  first character of delim is used to terminate each input line, rather than newline.  If delim is the empty string, mapfile will terminate a line when it reads a NUL charac‐\n                     ter.\n              -n     Copy at most count lines.  If count is 0, all lines are copied.\n              -O     Begin assigning to array at index origin.  The default index is 0.\n              -s     Discard the first count lines read.\n              -t     Remove a trailing delim (default newline) from each line read.\n              -u     Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.\n              -C     Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read.  The -c option specifies quantum.\n              -c     Specify the number of lines read between each call to callback.\n\n              If -C is specified without -c, the default quantum is 5000.  When callback is evaluated, it is supplied the index of the next array element to be assigned and the line to  be  assigned\n              to that element as additional arguments.  callback is evaluated after the line is read but before the array element is assigned.\n\n              If not supplied with an explicit origin, mapfile will clear array before assigning to it.\n\n              mapfile returns successfully unless an invalid option or option argument is supplied, array is invalid or unassignable, or if array is not an indexed array.\n\n       popd [-n] [+n] [-n]\n              Removes  entries  from  the directory stack.  With no arguments, removes the top directory from the stack, and performs a cd to the new top directory.  Arguments, if supplied, have the\n              following meanings:\n              -n     Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing directories from the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated.\n              +n     Removes the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero.  For example: ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' the second.\n              -n     Removes the nth entry counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero.  For example: ``popd -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next to last.\n\n              If the popd command is successful, a dirs is performed as well, and the return status is 0.  popd returns false if an invalid option is encountered, the directory  stack  is  empty,  a\n              non-existent directory stack entry is specified, or the directory change fails.\n\n       printf [-v var] format [arguments]\n              Write  the  formatted arguments to the standard output under the control of the format.  The -v option causes the output to be assigned to the variable var rather than being printed to\n              the standard output.\n\n              The format is a character string which contains three types of objects: plain characters, which are simply copied to standard output, character escape sequences,  which  are  converted\n              and  copied  to  the standard output, and format specifications, each of which causes printing of the next successive argument.  In addition to the standard printf(1) format specifica‐\n              tions, printf interprets the following extensions:\n              %b     causes printf to expand backslash escape sequences in the corresponding argument in the same way as echo -e.\n              %q     causes printf to output the corresponding argument in a format that can be reused as shell input.\n              %(datefmt)T\n                     causes printf to output the date-time string resulting from using datefmt as a format string for strftime(3).  The corresponding argument is an integer representing  the  number\n                     of seconds since the epoch.  Two special argument values may be used: -1 represents the current time, and -2 represents the time the shell was invoked.  If no argument is speci‐\n                     fied, conversion behaves as if -1 had been given.  This is an exception to the usual printf behavior.\n\n              Arguments to non-string format specifiers are treated as C constants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and if the leading character is a single or double quote, the\n              value is the ASCII value of the following character.\n\n              The  format  is reused as necessary to consume all of the arguments.  If the format requires more arguments than are supplied, the extra format specifications behave as if a zero value\n              or null string, as appropriate, had been supplied.  The return value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.\n\n       pushd [-n] [+n] [-n]\n       pushd [-n] [dir]\n              Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working directory.  With no arguments, pushd exchanges the top two\n              directories and returns 0, unless the directory stack is empty.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:\n              -n     Suppresses the normal change of directory when rotating or adding directories to the stack, so that only the stack is manipulated.\n              +n     Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero) is at the top.\n              -n     Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero) is at the top.\n              dir    Adds dir to the directory stack at the top, making it the new current working directory as if it had been supplied as the argument to the cd builtin.\n\n              If  the  pushd command is successful, a dirs is performed as well.  If the first form is used, pushd returns 0 unless the cd to dir fails.  With the second form, pushd returns 0 unless\n              the directory stack is empty, a non-existent directory stack element is specified, or the directory change to the specified new current directory fails.\n\n       pwd [-LP]\n              Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory.  The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the -P option is supplied or the -o physical option to the set builtin\n              command is enabled.  If the -L option is used, the pathname printed may contain symbolic links.  The return status is 0 unless an error occurs while reading the name of the current di‐\n              rectory or an invalid option is supplied.\n\n       read [-ers] [-a aname] [-d delim] [-i text] [-n nchars] [-N nchars] [-p prompt] [-t timeout] [-u fd] [name ...]\n              One line is read from the standard input, or from the file descriptor fd supplied as an argument to the -u option, split into words as described above under  Word  Splitting,  and  the\n              first  word  is assigned to the first name, the second word to the second name, and so on.  If there are more words than names, the remaining words and their intervening delimiters are\n              assigned to the last name.  If there are fewer words read from the input stream than names, the remaining names are assigned empty values.  The characters in IFS are used to split  the\n              line into words using the same rules the shell uses for expansion (described above under Word Splitting).  The backslash character (\\) may be used to remove any special meaning for the\n              next character read and for line continuation.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:\n              -a aname\n                     The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array variable aname, starting at 0.  aname is unset before any new values are assigned.  Other name arguments are ignored.\n              -d delim\n                     The first character of delim is used to terminate the input line, rather than newline.  If delim is the empty string, read will terminate a line when it reads a NUL character.\n              -e     If the standard input is coming from a terminal, readline (see READLINE above) is used to obtain the line.  Readline uses the current (or default, if line editing was not previ‐\n                     ously active) editing settings, but uses Readline's default filename completion.\n              -i text\n                     If readline is being used to read the line, text is placed into the editing buffer before editing begins.\n              -n nchars\n                     read  returns after reading nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, but honors a delimiter if fewer than nchars characters are read before the delim‐\n                     iter.\n              -N nchars\n                     read returns after reading exactly nchars characters rather than waiting for a complete line of input, unless EOF is encountered or read times out.  Delimiter characters encoun‐\n                     tered  in  the input are not treated specially and do not cause read to return until nchars characters are read.  The result is not split on the characters in IFS; the intent is\n                     that the variable is assigned exactly the characters read (with the exception of backslash; see the -r option below).\n              -p prompt\n                     Display prompt on standard error, without a trailing newline, before attempting to read any input.  The prompt is displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.\n              -r     Backslash does not act as an escape character.  The backslash is considered to be part of the line.  In particular, a backslash-newline pair may not then be used as a line  con‐\n                     tinuation.\n              -s     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, characters are not echoed.\n              -t timeout\n                     Cause  read to time out and return failure if a complete line of input (or a specified number of characters) is not read within timeout seconds.  timeout may be a decimal number\n                     with a fractional portion following the decimal point.  This option is only effective if read is reading input from a terminal, pipe, or other special file;  it  has  no  effect\n                     when reading from regular files.  If read times out, read saves any partial input read into the specified variable name.  If timeout is 0, read returns immediately, without try‐\n                     ing to read any data.  The exit status is 0 if input is available on the specified file descriptor, non-zero otherwise.  The exit status is greater than 128 if  the  timeout  is\n                     exceeded.\n              -u fd  Read input from file descriptor fd.\n\n              If  no  names  are  supplied,  the line read is assigned to the variable REPLY.  The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file is encountered, read times out (in which case the status is\n              greater than 128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a readonly variable) occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied as the argument to -u.\n\n       readonly [-aAf] [-p] [name[=word] ...]\n              The given names are marked readonly; the values of these names may not be changed by subsequent assignment.  If the -f option is supplied, the functions corresponding to the names  are\n              so  marked.   The  -a option restricts the variables to indexed arrays; the -A option restricts the variables to associative arrays.  If both options are supplied, -A takes precedence.\n              If no name arguments are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed.  The other options may be used to restrict the output to a subset of  the  set\n              of  readonly  names.  The -p option causes output to be displayed in a format that may be reused as input.  If a variable name is followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to\n              word.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.\n\n       return [n]\n              Causes a function to stop executing and return the value specified by n to its caller.  If n is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed in  the  function  body.\n              If return is executed by a trap handler, the last command used to determine the status is the last command executed before the trap handler.  If return is executed during a DEBUG trap,\n              the last command used to determine the status is the last command executed by the trap handler before return was invoked.  If return is used outside a function, but during execution of\n              a script by the .  (source) command, it causes the shell to stop executing that script and return either n or the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit\n              status of the script.  If n is supplied, the return value is its least significant 8 bits.  The return status is non-zero if return is supplied a non-numeric argument, or is used  out‐\n              side a function and not during execution of a script by . or source.  Any command associated with the RETURN trap is executed before execution resumes after the function or script.\n\n       set [--abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o option-name] [arg ...]\n       set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o option-name] [arg ...]\n              Without  options, the name and value of each shell variable are displayed in a format that can be reused as input for setting or resetting the currently-set variables.  Read-only vari‐\n              ables cannot be reset.  In posix mode, only shell variables are listed.  The output is sorted according to the current locale.  When options are specified, they set or unset shell  at‐\n              tributes.   Any  arguments remaining after option processing are treated as values for the positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to $1, $2, ...  $n.  Options, if specified,\n              have the following meanings:\n              -a      Each variable or function that is created or modified is given the export attribute and marked for export to the environment of subsequent commands.\n              -b      Report the status of terminated background jobs immediately, rather than before the next primary prompt.  This is effective only when job control is enabled.\n              -e      Exit immediately if a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command (see SHELL GRAMMAR above), exits with a non-zero status.  The shell\n                      does  not  exit  if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test following the if or elif reserved words,\n                      part of any command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is be‐\n                      ing  inverted  with  !.   If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while -e was being ignored, the shell does not exit.  A\n                      trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the shell exits.  This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see COMMAND EXECUTION  ENVIRON‐\n                      MENT above), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all the commands in the subshell.\n\n                      If  a compound command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be af‐\n                      fected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command returns a failure status.  If a compound command or shell function sets -e while executing in a context  where  -e  is\n                      ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.\n              -f      Disable pathname expansion.\n              -h      Remember the location of commands as they are looked up for execution.  This is enabled by default.\n              -k      All arguments in the form of assignment statements are placed in the environment for a command, not just those that precede the command name.\n              -m      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This option is on by default for interactive shells on systems that support it (see JOB CONTROL above).  All processes run in a separate\n                      process group.  When a background job completes, the shell prints a line containing its exit status.\n              -n      Read commands but do not execute them.  This may be used to check a shell script for syntax errors.  This is ignored by interactive shells.\n              -o option-name\n                      The option-name can be one of the following:\n                      allexport\n                              Same as -a.\n                      braceexpand\n                              Same as -B.\n                      emacs   Use an emacs-style command line editing interface.  This is enabled by default when the shell is interactive, unless the shell is started with the  --noediting  option.\n                              This also affects the editing interface used for read -e.\n                      errexit Same as -e.\n                      errtrace\n                              Same as -E.\n                      functrace\n                              Same as -T.\n                      hashall Same as -h.\n                      histexpand\n                              Same as -H.\n                      history Enable command history, as described above under HISTORY.  This option is on by default in interactive shells.\n                      ignoreeof\n                              The effect is as if the shell command ``IGNOREEOF=10'' had been executed (see Shell Variables above).\n                      keyword Same as -k.\n                      monitor Same as -m.\n                      noclobber\n                              Same as -C.\n                      noexec  Same as -n.\n                      noglob  Same as -f.\n                      nolog   Currently ignored.\n                      notify  Same as -b.\n                      nounset Same as -u.\n                      onecmd  Same as -t.\n                      physical\n                              Same as -P.\n                      pipefail\n                              If  set,  the  return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit suc‐\n                              cessfully.  This option is disabled by default.\n                      posix   Change the behavior of bash where the default operation differs from the POSIX standard to match the standard (posix mode).  See SEE ALSO below for  a  reference  to  a\n                              document that details how posix mode affects bash's behavior.\n                      privileged\n                              Same as -p.\n                      verbose Same as -v.\n                      vi      Use a vi-style command line editing interface.  This also affects the editing interface used for read -e.\n                      xtrace  Same as -x.\n                      If  -o  is supplied with no option-name, the values of the current options are printed.  If +o is supplied with no option-name, a series of set commands to recreate the current\n                      option settings is displayed on the standard output.\n              -p      Turn on privileged mode.  In this mode, the $ENV and $BASH_ENV files are not processed, shell functions are not inherited from the environment, and the SHELLOPTS, BASHOPTS, CD‐\n                      PATH,  and  GLOBIGNORE variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored.  If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the real user (group)\n                      id, and the -p option is not supplied, these actions are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id.  If the -p option is supplied  at  startup,  the  effective\n                      user id is not reset.  Turning this option off causes the effective user and group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.\n              -t      Exit after reading and executing one command.\n              -u      Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special parameters \"@\" and \"*\" as an error when performing parameter expansion.  If expansion is attempted on an unset vari‐\n                      able or parameter, the shell prints an error message, and, if not interactive, exits with a non-zero status.\n              -v      Print shell input lines as they are read.\n              -x      After expanding each simple command, for command, case command, select command, or arithmetic for command, display the expanded value of PS4, followed by the  command  and  its\n                      expanded arguments or associated word list.\n              -B      The shell performs brace expansion (see Brace Expansion above).  This is on by default.\n              -C      If set, bash does not overwrite an existing file with the >, >&, and <> redirection operators.  This may be overridden when creating output files by using the redirection oper‐\n                      ator >| instead of >.\n              -E      If set, any trap on ERR is inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.  The ERR trap is normally not inherited in such\n                      cases.\n              -H      Enable !  style history substitution.  This option is on by default when the shell is interactive.\n              -P      If  set,  the  shell does not resolve symbolic links when executing commands such as cd that change the current working directory.  It uses the physical directory structure in‐\n                      stead.  By default, bash follows the logical chain of directories when performing commands which change the current directory.\n              -T      If set, any traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.  The DEBUG and RETURN traps  are\n                      normally not inherited in such cases.\n              --      If no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are unset.  Otherwise, the positional parameters are set to the args, even if some of them begin with a -.\n              -       Signal  the  end  of options, cause all remaining args to be assigned to the positional parameters.  The -x and -v options are turned off.  If there are no args, the positional\n                      parameters remain unchanged.\n\n              The options are off by default unless otherwise noted.  Using + rather than - causes these options to be turned off.  The options can also be specified as arguments to an invocation of\n              the shell.  The current set of options may be found in $-.  The return status is always true unless an invalid option is encountered.\n\n       shift [n]\n              The positional parameters from n+1 ... are renamed to $1 ....  Parameters represented by the numbers $# down to $#-n+1 are unset.  n must be a non-negative number less than or equal to\n              $#.  If n is 0, no parameters are changed.  If n is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  If n is greater than $#, the positional parameters are not changed.  The return status is greater\n              than zero if n is greater than $# or less than zero; otherwise 0.\n\n       shopt [-pqsu] [-o] [optname ...]\n              Toggle  the  values of settings controlling optional shell behavior.  The settings can be either those listed below, or, if the -o option is used, those available with the -o option to\n              the set builtin command.  With no options, or with the -p option, a list of all settable options is displayed, with an indication of whether or not each is set; if  optnames  are  sup‐\n              plied, the output is restricted to those options.  The -p option causes output to be displayed in a form that may be reused as input.  Other options have the following meanings:\n              -s     Enable (set) each optname.\n              -u     Disable (unset) each optname.\n              -q     Suppresses  normal  output  (quiet mode); the return status indicates whether the optname is set or unset.  If multiple optname arguments are given with -q, the return status is\n                     zero if all optnames are enabled; non-zero otherwise.\n              -o     Restricts the values of optname to be those defined for the -o option to the set builtin.\n\n              If either -s or -u is used with no optname arguments, shopt shows only those options which are set or unset, respectively.  Unless otherwise noted, the shopt options are disabled  (un‐\n              set) by default.\n\n              The return status when listing options is zero if all optnames are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When setting or unsetting options, the return status is zero unless an optname is not a\n              valid shell option.\n\n              The list of shopt options is:\n\n              assoc_expand_once\n                      If set, the shell suppresses multiple evaluation of associative array subscripts during arithmetic expression evaluation, while executing builtins that can perform variable as‐\n                      signments, and while executing builtins that perform array dereferencing.\n              autocd  If set, a command name that is the name of a directory is executed as if it were the argument to the cd command.  This option is only used by interactive shells.\n              cdable_vars\n                      If set, an argument to the cd builtin command that is not a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable whose value is the directory to change to.\n              cdspell If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory component in a cd command will be corrected.  The errors checked for are transposed characters, a missing character, and one\n                      character too many.  If a correction is found, the corrected filename is printed, and the command proceeds.  This option is only used by interactive shells.\n              checkhash\n                      If set, bash checks that a command found in the hash table exists before trying to execute it.  If a hashed command no longer exists, a normal path search is performed.\n              checkjobs\n                      If set, bash lists the status of any stopped and running jobs before exiting an interactive shell.  If any jobs are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a  second\n                      exit is attempted without an intervening command (see JOB CONTROL above).  The shell always postpones exiting if any jobs are stopped.\n              checkwinsize\n                      If set, bash checks the window size after each external (non-builtin) command and, if necessary, updates the values of LINES and COLUMNS.  This option is enabled by default.\n              cmdhist If  set,  bash  attempts to save all lines of a multiple-line command in the same history entry.  This allows easy re-editing of multi-line commands.  This option is enabled by\n                      default, but only has an effect if command history is enabled, as described above under HISTORY.\n              compat31\n                      If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.1 with respect to quoted arguments to the [[ conditional command's =~ operator and locale-specific string comparison when\n                      using  the [[ conditional command's  operators.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII collation and strcmp(3); bash-4.1 and later use the current locale's collation\n                      sequence and strcoll(3).\n              compat32\n                      If set, bash changes its behavior to that of version 3.2 with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the [[ conditional command's  operators (see previ‐\n                      ous item) and the effect of interrupting a command list.  Bash versions 3.2 and earlier continue with the next command in the list after one terminates due to an interrupt.\n              compat40\n                      If  set,  bash  changes its behavior to that of version 4.0 with respect to locale-specific string comparison when using the [[ conditional command's  operators (see de‐\n                      scription of compat31) and the effect of interrupting a command list.  Bash versions 4.0 and later interrupt the list as if the shell received the interrupt; previous  versions\n                      continue with the next command in the list.\n              compat41\n                      If  set,  bash,  when in posix mode, treats a single quote in a double-quoted parameter expansion as a special character.  The single quotes must match (an even number) and the\n                      characters between the single quotes are considered quoted.  This is the behavior of posix mode through version 4.1.  The default bash behavior remains as in previous versions.\n              compat42\n                      If set, bash does not process the replacement string in the pattern substitution word expansion using quote removal.\n              compat43\n                      If set, bash does not print a warning message if an attempt is made to use a quoted compound array assignment as an argument to declare, makes word expansion  errors  non-fatal\n                      errors  that  cause the current command to fail (the default behavior is to make them fatal errors that cause the shell to exit), and does not reset the loop state when a shell\n                      function is executed (this allows break or continue in a shell function to affect loops in the caller's context).\n              compat44\n                      If set, bash saves the positional parameters to BASH_ARGV and BASH_ARGC before they are used, regardless of whether or not extended debugging mode is enabled.\n              complete_fullquote\n                      If set, bash quotes all shell metacharacters in filenames and directory names when performing completion.  If not set, bash removes metacharacters such as the dollar sign  from\n                      the set of characters that will be quoted in completed filenames when these metacharacters appear in shell variable references in words to be completed.  This means that dollar\n                      signs in variable names that expand to directories will not be quoted; however, any dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be quoted, either.  This is  active  only  when\n                      bash is using backslashes to quote completed filenames.  This variable is set by default, which is the default bash behavior in versions through 4.2.\n              direxpand\n                      If set, bash replaces directory names with the results of word expansion when performing filename completion.  This changes the contents of the readline editing buffer.  If not\n                      set, bash attempts to preserve what the user typed.\n              dirspell\n                      If set, bash attempts spelling correction on directory names during word completion if the directory name initially supplied does not exist.\n              dotglob If set, bash includes filenames beginning with a `.' in the results of pathname expansion.  The filenames ``.''  and ``..''  must always be matched explicitly, even if  dotglob\n                      is set.\n              execfail\n                      If  set,  a  non-interactive shell will not exit if it cannot execute the file specified as an argument to the exec builtin command.  An interactive shell does not exit if exec\n                      fails.\n              expand_aliases\n                      If set, aliases are expanded as described above under ALIASES.  This option is enabled by default for interactive shells.\n              extdebug\n                      If set at shell invocation, arrange to execute the debugger profile before the shell starts, identical to the --debugger option.  If set after invocation, behavior intended for\n                      use by debuggers is enabled:\n                      1.     The -F option to the declare builtin displays the source file name and line number corresponding to each function name supplied as an argument.\n                      2.     If the command run by the DEBUG trap returns a non-zero value, the next command is skipped and not executed.\n                      3.     If  the  command  run  by the DEBUG trap returns a value of 2, and the shell is executing in a subroutine (a shell function or a shell script executed by the . or source\n                             builtins), the shell simulates a call to return.\n                      4.     BASH_ARGC and BASH_ARGV are updated as described in their descriptions above.\n                      5.     Function tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the DEBUG and RETURN traps.\n                      6.     Error tracing is enabled: command substitution, shell functions, and subshells invoked with ( command ) inherit the ERR trap.\n              extglob If set, the extended pattern matching features described above under Pathname Expansion are enabled.\n              extquote\n                      If set, $'string' and $\"string\" quoting is performed within ${parameter} expansions enclosed in double quotes.  This option is enabled by default.\n              failglob\n                      If set, patterns which fail to match filenames during pathname expansion result in an expansion error.\n              force_fignore\n                      If set, the suffixes specified by the FIGNORE shell variable cause words to be ignored when performing word completion even if the ignored words are the only  possible  comple‐\n                      tions.  See SHELL VARIABLES above for a description of FIGNORE.  This option is enabled by default.\n              globasciiranges\n                      If  set, range expressions used in pattern matching bracket expressions (see Pattern Matching above) behave as if in the traditional C locale when performing comparisons.  That\n                      is, the current locale's collating sequence is not taken into account, so b will not collate between A and B, and upper-case and lower-case ASCII characters  will  collate  to‐\n                      gether.\n              globstar\n                      If  set,  the pattern ** used in a pathname expansion context will match all files and zero or more directories and subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by a /, only di‐\n                      rectories and subdirectories match.\n              gnu_errfmt\n                      If set, shell error messages are written in the standard GNU error message format.\n              histappend\n                      If set, the history list is appended to the file named by the value of the HISTFILE variable when the shell exits, rather than overwriting the file.\n              histreedit\n                      If set, and readline is being used, a user is given the opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.\n              histverify\n                      If set, and readline is being used, the results of history substitution are not immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the resulting line is loaded into the readline\n                      editing buffer, allowing further modification.\n              hostcomplete\n                      If  set, and readline is being used, bash will attempt to perform hostname completion when a word containing a @ is being completed (see Completing under READLINE above).  This\n                      is enabled by default.\n              huponexit\n                      If set, bash will send SIGHUP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.\n              inherit_errexit\n                      If set, command substitution inherits the value of the errexit option, instead of unsetting it in the subshell environment.  This option is enabled when posix mode is enabled.\n              interactive_comments\n                      If set, allow a word beginning with # to cause that word and all remaining characters on that line to be ignored in an interactive shell (see COMMENTS above).  This  option  is\n                      enabled by default.\n              lastpipe\n                      If set, and job control is not active, the shell runs the last command of a pipeline not executed in the background in the current shell environment.\n              lithist If set, and the cmdhist option is enabled, multi-line commands are saved to the history with embedded newlines rather than using semicolon separators where possible.\n              localvar_inherit\n                      If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes of a variable of the same name that exists at a previous scope before any new value is assigned.  The nameref attribute\n                      is not inherited.\n              localvar_unset\n                      If set, calling unset on local variables in previous function scopes marks them so subsequent lookups find them unset until that function returns. This is identical to the  be‐\n                      havior of unsetting local variables at the current function scope.\n              login_shell\n                      The shell sets this option if it is started as a login shell (see INVOCATION above).  The value may not be changed.\n              mailwarn\n                      If set, and a file that bash is checking for mail has been accessed since the last time it was checked, the message ``The mail in mailfile has been read'' is displayed.\n              no_empty_cmd_completion\n                      If set, and readline is being used, bash will not attempt to search the PATH for possible completions when completion is attempted on an empty line.\n              nocaseglob\n                      If set, bash matches filenames in a case-insensitive fashion when performing pathname expansion (see Pathname Expansion above).\n              nocasematch\n                      If  set, bash matches patterns in a case-insensitive fashion when performing matching while executing case or [[ conditional commands, when performing pattern substitution word\n                      expansions, or when filtering possible completions as part of programmable completion.\n              nullglob\n                      If set, bash allows patterns which match no files (see Pathname Expansion above) to expand to a null string, rather than themselves.\n              progcomp\n                      If set, the programmable completion facilities (see Programmable Completion above) are enabled.  This option is enabled by default.\n              progcomp_alias\n                      If set, and programmable completion is enabled, bash treats a command name that doesn't have any completions as a possible alias and attempts alias  expansion.  If  it  has  an\n                      alias, bash attempts programmable completion using the command word resulting from the expanded alias.\n              promptvars\n                      If  set,  prompt  strings undergo parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal after being expanded as described in PROMPTING above.  This\n                      option is enabled by default.\n              restricted_shell\n                      The shell sets this option if it is started in restricted mode (see RESTRICTED SHELL below).  The value may not be changed.  This is not reset when the startup files  are  exe‐\n                      cuted, allowing the startup files to discover whether or not a shell is restricted.\n              shift_verbose\n                      If set, the shift builtin prints an error message when the shift count exceeds the number of positional parameters.\n              sourcepath\n                      If set, the source (.) builtin uses the value of PATH to find the directory containing the file supplied as an argument.  This option is enabled by default.\n              xpg_echo\n                      If set, the echo builtin expands backslash-escape sequences by default.\n\n       suspend [-f]\n              Suspend  the  execution  of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  A login shell cannot be suspended; the -f option can be used to override this and force the suspension.  The\n              return status is 0 unless the shell is a login shell and -f is not supplied, or if job control is not enabled.\n\n       test expr\n       [ expr ]\n              Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of the conditional expression expr.  Each operator and operand must be a separate argument.  Expressions  are  com‐\n              posed  of  the  primaries described above under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS.  test does not accept any options, nor does it accept and ignore an argument of -- as signifying the end of op‐\n              tions.\n\n              Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in decreasing order of precedence.  The evaluation depends on the number of arguments; see below.  Operator precedence\n              is used when there are five or more arguments.\n              ! expr True if expr is false.\n              ( expr )\n                     Returns the value of expr.  This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.\n              expr1 -a expr2\n                     True if both expr1 and expr2 are true.\n              expr1 -o expr2\n                     True if either expr1 or expr2 is true.\n\n              test and [ evaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.\n\n              0 arguments\n                     The expression is false.\n              1 argument\n                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.\n              2 arguments\n                     If  the first argument is !, the expression is true if and only if the second argument is null.  If the first argument is one of the unary conditional operators listed above un‐\n                     der CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the expression is true if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression is false.\n              3 arguments\n                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.  If the second argument is one of the binary conditional operators listed above under CONDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS, the  re‐\n                     sult  of the expression is the result of the binary test using the first and third arguments as operands.  The -a and -o operators are considered binary operators when there are\n                     three arguments.  If the first argument is !, the value is the negation of the two-argument test using the second and third arguments.  If the first argument is  exactly  (  and\n                     the third argument is exactly ), the result is the one-argument test of the second argument.  Otherwise, the expression is false.\n              4 arguments\n                     If  the  first argument is !, the result is the negation of the three-argument expression composed of the remaining arguments.  Otherwise, the expression is parsed and evaluated\n                     according to precedence using the rules listed above.\n              5 or more arguments\n                     The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence using the rules listed above.\n\n              When used with test or [, the  operators sort lexicographically using ASCII ordering.\n\n       times  Print the accumulated user and system times for the shell and for processes run from the shell.  The return status is 0.\n\n       trap [-lp] [[arg] sigspec ...]\n              The command arg is to be read and executed when the shell receives signal(s) sigspec.  If arg is absent (and there is a single sigspec) or -, each specified  signal  is  reset  to  its\n              original  disposition  (the value it had upon entrance to the shell).  If arg is the null string the signal specified by each sigspec is ignored by the shell and by the commands it in‐\n              vokes.  If arg is not present and -p has been supplied, then the trap commands associated with each sigspec are displayed.  If no arguments are supplied or if only -p  is  given,  trap\n              prints the list of commands associated with each signal.  The -l option causes the shell to print a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers.  Each sigspec is either a sig‐\n              nal name defined in , or a signal number.  Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional.\n\n              If a sigspec is EXIT (0) the command arg is executed on exit from the shell.  If a sigspec is DEBUG, the command arg is executed before every simple command, for command, case command,\n              select  command,  every arithmetic for command, and before the first command executes in a shell function (see SHELL GRAMMAR above).  Refer to the description of the extdebug option to\n              the shopt builtin for details of its effect on the DEBUG trap.  If a sigspec is RETURN, the command arg is executed each time a shell function or a script executed with the . or source\n              builtins finishes executing.\n\n              If  a sigspec is ERR, the command arg is executed whenever a pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list, or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, sub‐\n              ject to the following conditions.  The ERR trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test in an\n              if statement, part of a command executed in a && or || list except the command following the final && or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command's return value is\n              being inverted using !.  These are the same conditions obeyed by the errexit (-e) option.\n\n              Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset.  Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original values in a subshell or subshell environment\n              when one is created.  The return status is false if any sigspec is invalid; otherwise trap returns true.\n\n       type [-aftpP] name [name ...]\n              With  no  options,  indicate  how  each  name  would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If the -t option is used, type prints a string which is one of alias, keyword, function,\n              builtin, or file if name is an alias, shell reserved word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If the name is not found, then nothing is printed,  and  an  exit  status  of\n              false  is  returned.   If  the -p option is used, type either returns the name of the disk file that would be executed if name were specified as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t\n              name'' would not return file.  The -P option forces a PATH search for each name, even if ``type -t name'' would not return file.  If a command is hashed, -p and  -P  print  the  hashed\n              value,  which  is  not  necessarily  the file that appears first in PATH.  If the -a option is used, type prints all of the places that contain an executable named name.  This includes\n              aliases and functions, if and only if the -p option is not also used.  The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using -a.  The -f option suppresses shell function lookup,  as\n              with the command builtin.  type returns true if all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.\n\n       ulimit [-HSabcdefiklmnpqrstuvxPT [limit]]\n              Provides  control  over  the  resources  available to the shell and to processes started by it, on systems that allow such control.  The -H and -S options specify that the hard or soft\n              limit is set for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value of the hard limit.   If  neither\n              -H  nor  -S  is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set.  The value of limit can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values hard, soft, or\n              unlimited, which stand for the current hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.  If limit is omitted, the current value of the soft  limit  of  the  resource  is\n              printed, unless the -H option is given.  When more than one resource is specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:\n              -a     All current limits are reported\n              -b     The maximum socket buffer size\n              -c     The maximum size of core files created\n              -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment\n              -e     The maximum scheduling priority (\"nice\")\n              -f     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its children\n              -i     The maximum number of pending signals\n              -k     The maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated\n              -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory\n              -m     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not honor this limit)\n              -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be set)\n              -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)\n              -q     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues\n              -r     The maximum real-time scheduling priority\n              -s     The maximum stack size\n              -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds\n              -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user\n              -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell and, on some systems, to its children\n              -x     The maximum number of file locks\n              -P     The maximum number of pseudoterminals\n              -T     The maximum number of threads\n\n              If limit is given, and the -a option is not used, limit is the new value of the specified resource.  If no option is given, then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, ex‐\n              cept for -t, which is in seconds; -p, which is in units of 512-byte blocks; -P, -T, -b, -k, -n, and -u, which are unscaled values; and, when in posix mode, -c  and  -f,  which  are  in\n              512-byte increments.  The return status is 0 unless an invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.\n\n       umask [-p] [-S] [mode]\n              The  user file-creation mask is set to mode.  If mode begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that ac‐\n              cepted by chmod(1).  If mode is omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  The -S option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic form; the default output is an octal number.\n              If the -p option is supplied, and mode is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input.  The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no mode argu‐\n              ment was supplied, and false otherwise.\n\n       unalias [-a] [name ...]\n              Remove each name from the list of defined aliases.  If -a is supplied, all alias definitions are removed.  The return value is true unless a supplied name is not a defined alias.\n\n       unset [-fv] [-n] [name ...]\n              For each name, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If the -v option is given, each name refers to a shell variable, and that variable is removed.  Read-only  variables  may\n              not  be unset.  If -f is specified, each name refers to a shell function, and the function definition is removed.  If the -n option is supplied, and name is a variable with the nameref\n              attribute, name will be unset rather than the variable it references.  -n has no effect if the -f option is supplied.  If no options are supplied, each name refers to  a  variable;  if\n              there  is  no  variable  by  that name, any function with that name is unset.  Each unset variable or function is removed from the environment passed to subsequent commands.  If any of\n              COMP_WORDBREAKS, RANDOM, SECONDS, LINENO, HISTCMD, FUNCNAME, GROUPS, or DIRSTACK are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are subsequently reset.  The exit status is\n              true unless a name is readonly.\n\n       wait [-fn] [id ...]\n              Wait  for each specified child process and return its termination status.  Each id may be a process ID or a job specification; if a job spec is given, all processes in that job's pipe‐\n              line are waited for.  If id is not given, all currently active child processes are waited for, and the return status is zero.  If the -n option is supplied, wait waits for any  job  to\n              terminate  and returns its exit status.  If the -f option is supplied, and job control is enabled, wait forces id to terminate before returning its status, instead of returning when it\n              changes status.  If id specifies a non-existent process or job, the return status is 127.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit status of the last process or job waited for.\n\nRESTRICTED SHELL\n       If bash is started with the name rbash, or the -r option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell is used to set up an environment more controlled than the\n       standard shell.  It behaves identically to bash with the exception that the following are disallowed or not performed:\n\n       •      changing directories with cd\n\n       •      setting or unsetting the values of SHELL, PATH, ENV, or BASH_ENV\n\n       •      specifying command names containing /\n\n       •      specifying a filename containing a / as an argument to the .  builtin command\n\n       •      specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument to the -p option to the hash builtin command\n\n       •      importing function definitions from the shell environment at startup\n\n       •      parsing the value of SHELLOPTS from the shell environment at startup\n\n       •      redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirection operators\n\n       •      using the exec builtin command to replace the shell with another command\n\n       •      adding or deleting builtin commands with the -f and -d options to the enable builtin command\n\n       •      using the enable builtin command to enable disabled shell builtins\n\n       •      specifying the -p option to the command builtin command\n\n       •      turning off restricted mode with set +r or set +o restricted.\n\n       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.\n\n       When a command that is found to be a shell script is executed (see COMMAND EXECUTION above), rbash turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.\n\nSEE ALSO\n       Bash Reference Manual, Brian Fox and Chet Ramey\n       The Gnu Readline Library, Brian Fox and Chet Ramey\n       The Gnu History Library, Brian Fox and Chet Ramey\n       Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) Part 2: Shell and Utilities, IEEE --\n              http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/\n       http://tiswww.case.edu/~chet/bash/POSIX -- a description of posix mode\n       sh(1), ksh(1), csh(1)\n       emacs(1), vi(1)\n       readline(3)\n\nFILES\n       /bin/bash\n              The bash executable\n       /etc/profile\n              The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells\n       /etc/bash.bashrc\n              The systemwide per-interactive-shell startup file\n       /etc/bash.bash.logout\n              The systemwide login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits\n       ~/.bash_profile\n              The personal initialization file, executed for login shells\n       ~/.bashrc\n              The individual per-interactive-shell startup file\n       ~/.bash_logout\n              The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits\n       ~/.inputrc\n              Individual readline initialization file\n\nAUTHORS\n       Brian Fox, Free Software Foundation\n       bfox@gnu.org\n\n       Chet Ramey, Case Western Reserve University\n       chet.ramey@case.edu\n\nBUG REPORTS\n       If  you  find  a  bug in bash, you should report it.  But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest version of bash.  The latest version is always\n       available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bash/.\n\n       Once you have determined that a bug actually exists, use the bashbug command to submit a bug report.  If you have a fix, you are encouraged to mail that as well!  Suggestions and `philosophi‐\n       cal' bug reports may be mailed to bug-bash@gnu.org or posted to the Usenet newsgroup gnu.bash.bug.\n\n       ALL bug reports should include:\n\n       The version number of bash\n       The hardware and operating system\n       The compiler used to compile\n       A description of the bug behaviour\n       A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug\n\n       bashbug inserts the first three items automatically into the template it provides for filing a bug report.\n\n       Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed to chet.ramey@case.edu.\n\nBUGS\n       It's too big and too slow.\n\n       There are some subtle differences between bash and traditional versions of sh, mostly because of the POSIX specification.\n\n       Aliases are confusing in some uses.\n\n       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.\n\n       Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are not handled gracefully when process suspension is attempted.  When a process is stopped, the shell immediately executes the\n       next command in the sequence.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands between parentheses to force it into a subshell, which may be stopped as a unit.\n\n       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.\n\n       There may be only one active coprocess at a time.\n\nGNU Bash 5.0                                                                                2018 December 7                                                                                    BASH(1)\n"}}}
